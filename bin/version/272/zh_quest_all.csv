LoadingtheChunks-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALOg==.json,2874,§1§lLoading the Chunks,"Minecraft works in chunks - the 16x16 columns of blocks from bedrock to sky. The chunks in a radius around you are simulated or, in other words, chunkloaded. If a chunk is not loaded, nothing happens in it - crops don't grow, machines don't work. Thus, you want to have your base chunkloaded when you're off exploring. Later on, you want your base chunkloaded so things don't spontaneously blow up, especially multi-block machines.

You can chunkload in a few ways:

1) The ServerUtilities mod. With default settings, you will not be able to chunkload. Feel free to change that in the config if you are in singleplayer (SP) or running your own server.

2) Use four types of Anchors from Railcraft, although they are not craftable until the Low Voltage (LV) tier. In SP, or a server you run, cheat in Admin Anchors to chunkload forever, for free. They're limited on servers to prevent TPS dropping from people chunkloading a base forever when they aren't even there. On the officials, you need to use Ender Fragments, Ender Pearls, or Coins to fuel them. Look at the tooltip on each for how long it will work, and in what chunkloader.

(不过不可否认,当你进入游戏中期后,几乎就没啥时间出去浪了,但你还是想要确保基地里的一切井井有条地运行,尤其是多方块机器可能因为加载问题而爆炸,比如部分加载造成的供水问题)你需要使区块保持加载,才能让自己的工厂夜以继日地干活. 有多种方法可以达到这一目的.1) 安装FTBUtilities,认领区块,再加载区块. 如果你是一个人玩的话,默认配置下的认领/加载数可能不够用,所以尽管增加数量吧. 不过修改配置文件只有在单人模式或私人服务器可以做到.2) 使用RC的锚. 一共有4种锚.你得到LV阶段以后才能制造它们. 在单人模式或是私人服务器中,你可以通过作弊获取管理员世界锚,免费永久加载区块. 在公共服务器上,为了防止长时间不上线玩家基地持续加载而大幅降低TPS,这些是被限制的. 在我们的官方服务器中,这些锚需要消耗末影碎片、末影珍珠或是区块加载器硬币.请查看tooltip,获知它们在什么锚中分别有多长的工作时间. 在官方服务器中,你也无法制造区块加载器硬币,你得通过其他方式获取. 不过,即使你在单人游戏中,如果想要让游戏更具挑战性,还是限制一下自己的区块加载吧.3) 使用chicken-chunks来获取类似锚的方块.但我们不建议这样,因为这玩意bug多多.4) 使用GT++的区块加载机.需要EU而不是末影珍珠.5) 使用某种能加载自身所在区块的方块,这里就不列了. 如果在公共服务器上,没有经过管理员允许就大量使用此类方块,那他可能会给你点颜色看看了.就算是某些原版方式也不行."

Many GTNH topics are explained in our Wiki at [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Main_Page[/url]. It does not have the same extent and structure as the Questbook, but some things are much better with pictures and tables! The wiki also has tips on extra topics like what additional mods might work with the pack, how GTNH can be installed for modern Java versions or how to set up a server.

Additionally, there is a spreadsheet at [url]https://www.gtnewhorizons.com/spreadsheet[/url] for the info you would want a spreadsheet for.

If you play through a launcher that relies on [warn]CurseForge[/warn], be aware that it doesn't always work properly. It doesn't play well with all the custom versions of mods that this pack has. So if you have any problems, first switch to another launcher like MultiMC, Prism, or Technic. The wiki has instructions there as well.

AE2FluidCrafting-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMsg==.json,3250,AE2 Fluid Crafting,"Fluid crafting directly integrated in your ME system. NO WAY!

AE2FC is a powerful addon that was backported for GTNH.

Now, what do you need to get that juicy stuff working?
Every ME System needs a Fluid Discretizer. It allows for on demand crafting. While you can use AE2FC without Fluid Discretizer for moving fluids, you need a Discretizer for autocrafting.

Then you also need a Fluid Terminal or a Fluid Processing Terminal for the Assembly Line. 

When creating patterns you will notice your fluids being placed as if they were items. 
Your finished patterns will look blue-ish. Placing those in a Dual Interface will allow AE2 to push the fluids and items both. Note. Fluids are being sent first, then items.
You can switch the dual interface on the top right if you want it to keep fluids in stock. 

If you use a blue pattern (fluid pattern) in a normal interface, AE2 will send the fluid as a fluid packet. This is just a representation of the fluid as an item. A fluid decoder can turn it back into a fluid and saves it in the fluid grid.

You can use an ingredient buffer (large or normal) so your items and fluids sent by a pattern can get stored internally in one block. The normal buffer can hold 9 items and 4 fluids whereas the large one can hold 27 items and 7 fluids. It is not needed, but you can use it to automate things with item and fluid conduits. 

If you want to automate single blocks its as easy as eating chocolate cake while on a diet:
Make the pattern, make an interface, boom- done! It will automatically insert the fluid in the fluid inventory of a single block machine. 

Even automating more difficult things like the Assembly Line becomes much easier with these tools.

BeamMeUpScotty-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ4Q==.json,2529,"Beam Me Up, Scotty","If you want to teleport stuff around using these, you'll need a drive in the SIOP, and at least 6 pylons hooked up. The pylons need to indicate the X, Y and Z dimensions, with you needing 1 more than you would think. If the efficiency goes below 100%, the AE cost will balloon enormously, so add more pylons to counteract that. After using a redstone signal to activate the SIOP, the blocks will be moved to the spatial IO dim, and the drive will move to the output, so you can send it somewhere else. This is very important to do properly if you want to use it as a teleporter. Otherwise you can get stuck there. Your network will need to be able to hold all the power needed to teleport at once, so you'll need at least one energy cell. You can only have one Pylon setup per controller, so consider putting them on a subnetwork.

Using 2 in the X and Z dimensions and 3 in the Y will give you a 1x2x1 teleporter to teleport yourself. You'll want a SIOP port on each side for sending and for receiving. But you'll still need to design a redstone contraption to activate them properly!

BundledAEChannel-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyw==.json,203,Bundled AE Channels,"P2P tunnels. You'll probably want a bunch of them! They act as teleport points from one place to another for the contained information.

They can pack up to 32 channels into 1 channel and transport those to the destination P2P bus. Each P2P tunnel requires 1 free channel. P2P connections cannot be nested, but one transport cable can carry multiple P2P connections. For a normal fluix cable, that's 4 P2P connections, and 16 for dense.

You can use separate cables to connect input p2ps to the controller and to transport from the controller to around your base, allowing for 32 output p2ps on one dense cable. Alternatively you can use an entirely separate controller as a transport network.

Generally, you'll want to have the first point be one side of an ME Controller block (remember you can add more!), and the other where some of your machines are.

A nice online guide can be found at [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Applied_Energistics_2[/url] under P2P tunnels.

If you want to use one of the P2P tunnels for something §oother§r than ME channels, use an applicable item on the center of the face of the tunnel, (for example, a GT cable for GT EU, redstone for RS signal, an RF conduit for RF, a torch for light, a bucket for fluid, a chest for items, or an OC cable for OC) and it will convert to that type, even if you pick it up.

P2P通道不可嵌套,但可一对多,而同一条传输频道的线缆也可以同时传输多个P2P的信息. 对于普通的ME玻璃线缆,可以连接4对P2P,而致密线缆可以连接16对. 如果仍然不够的话,你还可以为子网络添加ME控制器,或使用多个子网络.一般来说,P2P的入口会贴在主网络的ME控制器上,而出口会在你的机器那边.这里有一份不错的P2P线上教程https://tinyurl.com/GTNH-AE2. 如果你想使用其他种类的P2P通道,手持相应物品右键P2P面的中心即可(比如,GT线缆对应GT-EU模式,红石对应红石信号模式,RF导管对应RF模式,火把对应光模式,桶对应液体模式,箱子对应物品模式,OC线缆对应OC模式)切换为对应模式,拆下也会保留. 对其使用ME玻璃线缆即可将P2P通道切换回ME模式."

Each can carry 8 channels.  Quartz fibers don't carry channels but can carry energy. This is useful for providing power from your main network to independant subnetworks.

You can also color your cables - cables with different colors will not connect, so those can be used to expand network capacity by running parallel cables. Only fluix colored cables connect to all other colors. Later it will probably be more efficient to use P2P channels to jam a bunch of channels into 1.

E.g: (wood log -> planks) in the interface w/o upgrades would draw: 1*10 AE units, which is 5 EU (remember 1 EU = 2 AE)
(9 charcoal -> charcoal block) compressor recipe in the interface with 3 upgrades will draw 9*10*4^3*0.5 = 2070 EU, but only 45EU without any cards

AdvancedCokeOven-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMHw==.json,3103,Advanced Coke Oven,"Your power needs quadrupled since the last tier, and it's likely that you're not getting Charcoal fast enough. Instead of adding even more Coke Ovens, why not build an upgraded version of them?

The caveat is that you won't keep producing Creosote alongside the Charcoal from now on. It makes for decent power in the appropriate generators, and you might have already used it to produce Lubricant. Despite that, you can still get Creosote from processing in the next steps of this questline, so you can still get it if you need it. With that out of the way, let's move on to the Advanced Coke Oven (ACO).

How is it made? The ACO needs a lot more steps than the normal Coke Ovens, steps centered around Nether materials, cooked in the EBF and then cooled down. The cooling part is normally the Vacuum Freezer's job, as you will see later in progression, but you can't build it yet; because of that, you'll have to use IC2 coolant to finish the bricks used in the ACO. Once you've crafted all the blocks needed for this, you can put it together and start it up, to see what's different from before.

The speed of this new one is 1 Charcoal per second, or the equivalent to 90 Coke Ovens. The cost of this is the loss of the Creosote, and also that it needs fuel to work, making it so approaximately 1/16 of your Charcoal is lost in this step. Fortunately, you can automate it with item pipes, and the EnderIO conduits make it even simpler. Input wood, input charcoal, output charcoal.

There are some naturally-sourced, energetic oils that can be processed into a greener alternative of what oil pumping can lead you to, in this tier. While crude oil turns into Diesel, this oil turns into Biodiesel! 

In general, Biodiesel has less power per bucket than Diesel, which is its main drawback, to compensate for the renewable sources. You could source both of them from plants, but Oilberries are very slow compared to the option you might use, Rape flowers or Goldfish. They are an excellent source of Seed Oil or Fish Oil, but they are also IC2 crops, so their output scales with their stats. 

Between the two, Goldfish have a faster fluid extraction recipe, so they are often recommended for that reason, although it's not a dealbreaker. It's recommended that you get high-statted crops if you want to follow this route, although it is not a necessity, because there are other options that never go into these IC2 crops.

How many options are there, really? There are many, but they can be divided into 3 categories, and that's what the quest tasks focus on: IC2 crops in a Crop Manager, regular crops in a Multifarm or automatic fishing in a fish trap.

They are reasonably efficient, generating 90% of the EU shown in NEI per bucket of fuel, although Biodiesel has a lower fuel value than either Benzene or Diesel, but not by much. Besides the generators, you also need a big enough fuel input per tick to sustain your base, so make sure to expand your setup enough to fuel all of your other automations.

Biodiesel isn't the only thing you get from this process, though. As a side product, you also get Glycerol. Do not throw this away, it will prove itself useful when making epoxy resin, and possibly in other setups, to save you some work at a later time. When using singleblock Chemical Reactors, the recipe will stop if the Glycerol output is full, a situation in which a super tank will surely come in handy.

CarbonChemically-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFQ==.json,3093,"Carbon, Chemically","How does all of this organic stuff produce energy, anyways? You burn it, that's how! The heat from that burning heats up water into Steam, and this can make a Steam Turbine spin, generating rotational energy that can directly be converted into electricity with spinning magnetic fields. Pretty neat, right? The wood/charcoal provides the combustible material, and the atmosphere provides the oxygen to keep the fire going. With some chemistry, and GTNH magic, we can use these principles to generate power in an alternative way.

It's pretty much magic, really. Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a valid fuel for Gas Turbines, and it can be made with Charcoal and Oxygen. The CO has more power than the Charcoal used to make it, but the additional Oxygen will make this step not worth it if you get it from electrolyzing water or centrifuging air, since the EU needed for those crafts will make this process inefficient. There is, however, a more efficient way to automate Oxygen production, but you will need crops for it.

Your target is Sugar and an MV Electrolyzer. This will give you Oxygen at almost 1000 EU per bucket. Each bucket of CO produces 24000 EU, made from one Charcoal that produces roughly 16000 EU in Steam, and costing 560 EU per craft. The whole process gives around 6000 EU of free power per Charcoal, around 30% extra power overall!

CBDIntoSteam-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOA==.json,3128,CBD Into Steam,"There are no more Diesel-related upgrades for the CBD. To continue using Combustion Generators, or the LCE, you can only make your setup bigger or upgrade energy hatches. There is, however, a more power-dense fuel that uses CBD in its recipe, but there's a catch: it's a solid fuel, to be used in steam boilers, which gives it advantages and disadvantages.

Everything from this quest onwards is about those solid fuels. There are two versions, one with additional inputs over the other, and they both follow the same logic: they need to be converted to Steam, which is hard to transport, convert into EU and basically require the EV and IV Large Steam Boilers. However, the combination of these fuels and those boilers is much, much more fuel efficient than before, if you are willing to face the additional challenges in this kind of setup.

How does it generally go? If you already have CBD, you can get power from it by putting it directly in Combustion Generators. In this line, though, you need to automate Fuel Binder, add blocks of Charcoal, Coal or Coal Coke and then put the Super Fuel in a Titanium or Tungstensteel Large Boiler, where you get Superheated Steam.

CoalOrCharcoal-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMPg==.json,3134,Coal Or Charcoal,"The Super Fuels are blocks of burnable material, like Coal Blocks, which they need in their crafting recipe. It doesn't have to be Coal, though: you can do Coal, Charcoal or Coal Coke, and all of them make the same amount of Super Fuel. However, the amount of fluid fuel used changes based on which kind of block you used, which poses a problem.

(We will ignore Lignite Coal, since it is by far the worst option. If you want to use it, dealing with the efficiency problem is up to you.)

The problem is this: the amount of EU you save by choosing Charcoal instead of the other two is less than the amount of EU that the additional fuel can make. Basically, the most efficient option is Coal Coke, then Coal, then Charcoal. The easiest option to automate is certainly Charcoal, which means this is a choice between ease of automation and fuel efficiency. Even if you use Charcoal, you will still get more EU from the final fuel than what you used as input.

Coal can be automated too, though! There are many ways to do this, but the most popular way of automating items that aren't renewable by default is usually by using either IC2 crops or Forestry bees, both of which have their own renewable Coal.

Using a Brewery, you can add some Redstone to quickly convert this oil to Lubricant and keep it in stock for whatever machine or craft needs it.

Alternatively, you can get a bit of extra power from this. The fuel value per bucket is much lower than the big three, but it still has an interesting use. When the semifluid generators were broken, and the Creosote wasn't usable in them, there were setups using two max-size LP Railcraft boilers to turn the amount you get from one DT into the EU needed to run it, making that step completely free in terms of power.

FasterCharcoal-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMGA==.json,3096,Faster Charcoal,"Even if you have more wood, this won't help your power issues that much. Using it directly as fuel isn't going to do much for you as you move forward, and turning it into Charcoal will be very important. You have already built a Coke Oven, maybe more than one, but each one takes 90 seconds to produce one Charcoal, an abysmal rate. Unfortunately, there isn't any faster option in this tier, so you will have to build more of these ovens. How many, exactly?

There are many different goals you might want to go for, but a good metric for your power needs is a setup with 19 Coke Ovens. This number will create both Charcoal and Creosote Oil at a rate that will run two max-sized LP (Low Pressure) Railcraft Boilers, one solid and one liquid, with the quest for those coming right after this one. If you automate this entire setup, it will produce around 2 amps of MV, which are equivalent to 8 amps of LV, plenty of power for this tier and enough to advance you to the next one.

After building these Coke Ovens, you will need to automate them. There are a few ways to do this, but one of the cheapest ones is to use Item Pipes, made with Tin for example, with a Conveyor Module in the wood chest/drawer to put the wood in the ovens, and then one Hopper below each oven, into more Item Pipes, to gather the Charcoal. The Creosote is a bit harder to extract, but you can do it with Tinkers' Faucets on the side of each Coke Oven, with a Wooden Fluid Pipe directly under the faucet. You will need to keep reactivating them with redstone, which means you'll also need a redstone clock (there's a block dedicated to this purpose, named Redstone Clock, from Extra Utilities).",焦炉砖块,[3095],生生不息的木炭,"就算你有再多的原木,也无法对你的能源问题有太多帮助.随着科技的发展,直接将原木作为燃料越发乏力,这时将其转化为木炭就非常重要了.你已经造了一台焦炉,也有可能不止一台,但每台生产木炭的周期都是90秒,真是糟糕的速度.更不幸的是,在这个阶段还没有任何手段将其提速,所以你不得不建造一台又一台的焦炉.那么到底要多少呢?可能你想要达到的目标有很多,但有一个不错的参考指标,满足你能源需求大概需要一套24台焦炉.这个数字的焦炉制造木炭和杂酚油的速度,恰好可以供给两台最大尺寸的低压锅炉(RC),一台固态与一台液态,正好它们的相关任务也就要来了.如果你将这整个系统都完成了自动化,它将能产生大概2A-MV的电力,等于8A-LV,对于现阶段与下一阶段,这样的供电都绰绰有余了.建造完这些焦炉后,你还需要将它们自动化.有多种方式可以做到这一点,不过最便宜的方式就是使用物品管道,比方说锡物品管道,再配合连接在原木箱子/抽屉上的传送带覆盖板,将原木输送到焦炉内;然后每台焦炉下方配一个漏斗,通入物品管道,用以收集木炭. 杂酚油相对就麻烦一些,不过你可以使用匠魂的浇注口,插在每台焦炉的侧面,浇注口下方直接通入木制流体管道.你还需要通过红石信号不断激活这些浇注口,推荐使用红石钟(Extra-Utilities)."

Each of the fluids that can be separated from within the tar will stick at a different height level, sitting on top of all the others that are more dense than itself.

Basically, you need a multiblock, instead of a singleblock. The Distillation Tower you will need for this recipe has to be at least 6 blocks tall, with 1 input plus 5 outputs. Out of it, you will get Benzene, Toluene and Phenol, which are all viable gases for power alongside being very useful for progression (Toluene for compressing with TNT and moving past HV, Phenol for crafting circuits in the next tier and other chemical lines). You will also get various types of Dimethylbenzene. For now the only one of interest is 1,2-Dimethylbenzene which is a part of the PBI line in IV.

FurtherCharcoalD-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMKg==.json,3114,Further Charcoal Distillation,"The Distillation Tower you've recently unlocked can bring forth many, many more outputs than what you've done so far. If you look at NEI, you might see that there are other Charcoal-related fluids that have recipes in this multi, and this is the time to work with them: doing it all in singleblock Distlleries would be very wasteful.

The most important part about getting these fluids is the Pyrolyse Oven. If you haven't made one, it's highly recommended that you make at least one. You can upgrade both the energy hatch and the coils used in it to keep it up to speed with everything else, no need to build more than one. Aside from fulfilling the purpose of the Coke Oven, to cook Wood into Charcoal, it gives the choice of which of several fluids it also outputs as it does the processing. Most of the options are potentially useful, but a complete Benzene setup will prefer Charcoal Byproducts because they are, essentially, the complete product.

ATTENTION: This setup is technically HV, but it's quite expensive. It's fine if you move to EV first before you build this. It is in no way required to progress in HV.

With Charcoal Byproducts, the full setup involves DTing that into Wood Tar, Wood Vinegar and Wood Gas, and then DTing all of those into their respective outputs. With one tower for each, you will end up with a quad DT setup, very expensive overall in terms of Stainless Steel, but with huge savings compared to making 4 separate ones. Keep in mind, however, that they will not all have the same height. Additionally, Wood Gas is not as valuable as the other two (although it is a decent Ethylene source), so it's also a good idea to make 2 of the 4 DTs process that, and burn the Wood Gas for the little power it can provide.

In summary, this fuel is very, very efficient. Turbines can be made faster by losing some efficiency. You have more than enough fuel efficiency to spare!

Let's review this in more detail. Turbines produce EU based on the flow rate of the fuel that they are consuming. Their optimal flow represents the highest fuel efficiency they can reach (140% or 150% for the good turbines in these tiers), but you can increase the flow beyond that point and still get a higher EU/t value. However, the fuel becomes less efficient. A good tradeoff, if you need it.

Steam loses efficiency quickly if you do this, though. The right way to pull this off with Steam Turbines is to switch to Loose mode, a mode unique to them, which makes the optimal flow shoot way up at a considerable loss to fuel efficiency. The jump in EU/t is so high, however, that you can replace a whole squadron of turbines with just one or two, as you can see if you look at the turbine items' tooltips.

MassDistilledWat-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOg==.json,3130,Mass Distilled Water,"Water is completely free, that much is obvious. Distilled Water, though? It's the same input, but it needs a machine to process it into this version, and you best not choose singleblock Distilleries to do this, because they are incredibly slow and will never keep up with your demands.

The obvious option is a Distillation Tower. The less obvious option is a Steam Turbine multi, which outputs Distilled Water that is supposedly piped back to where the steam is made. However, there are several steam producers that use regular water, so you can try that? The DT is the simplest and most direct option, though. 3-high is the minimum, so you have to build it like that. It doesn't need a lot of power, it will fill up a tank of any size over time since the water input is completely free.

To prevent it from running continuously, though, here's a neat trick, in case you haven't done it already: take the output hatch on the second layer, where the Distilled Water comes from, and put it directly above the DT controller. Then, put a Fluid Detector Cover on the bottom side of the hatch and a Machine Controller Cover on the top side of the controller, so that the covers are facing each other. Set the controller cover to ""Disable with Redstone"", and the DT will stop after the fluid tank you've chosen is full.

Additionally, for Coal Coke, only the Alumentum option is available.

PyrolyseOven-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIA==.json,3104,Pyrolyse Oven,"Some setups really demand space in your base to work properly. You might have thought that when you finished the Coke Oven automation, but there's also an option in this tier that respects that need for speed by just being a gigantic multiblock: the Pyrolyse Oven.

In essence, it's the original GregTech large-scale wood processor. It is a massive structure, probably bigger than any other multi you've build before, but it uses simple materials like bronze and steel. If you're able to just throw stacks of those at a controller, you can put this behemoth together and enjoy an alternative to the Advanced Coke Oven that has some extra benefits. Unlike any of the other ovens, this one runs on EU, so you need to route your power back here to process the wood you're feeding it. 

What makes the Pyro valuable? It outputs a fluid alongside the Charcoal, which you can process for extra power and/or byproducts. Look at NEI to see all the alternatives available to you, this multi can usually output several different fluids, but only one at a time, decided by the circuit inside it. The one to choose at this time is Wood Tar, the same fluid you're extracting from the Charcoal. You get a small constant bonus from having built a Pyro, which is really nice.

However, the Pyro uses coils in a similar way to the EBF, and those coils affect the time each recipe takes: if you're using Cupronickel Coils, the recipe time is actually 2x what NEI says! This might be too slow for your needs, so make sure you check how much Charcoal you're getting from here. Kanthal Coils are available in MV, using the IC2 Coolant instead of the Vacuum Freezer.

Steam itself, however, is not the best option for all progression tiers, so the question is: what else can that wood do? That is what this questline will explain.

Each tier you reach will challenge you with bigger power needs.

To sustain all this, you might want a fully automated, infinite source of power and chemicals to handle this pack's progression. To achieve this, following the quests in this chapter is sure to be helpful.

As a final note, the power outputs of a fully renewable powergen like this are not as efficient as oil, which is the price to pay for being renewable. You will need a bigger machine setup to achieve the same EU/t output, but it is still very viable and worth it if you are willing to make this compromise.

Even if that's true, there is a constant output from your trees that has been left unused all this time: the saplings! No matter which tree you chose to automate, you are surely stockpiling the saplings matching that tree, since there's little that is really useful to do with them. At this point, though, you can set up a decent Biomass setup.

To clarify, Biomass is just a fluid made from plant stuff. It doesn't need to be saplings, but that's most likely something you have a lot of lying around. On top of that, there are multiple types of Biomass, one of them called Fermented Biomass, which is very similar but different, and the recommended path for you to take, since it needs less steps than the alternatives and gets you to the DT recipe just fine.

If you are already processing Wood Vinegar, you will have several repeat outputs, though. That said, if you complete this line, you will get Ethanol + Methanol and Ammonia, which make the Cetane-Boosted Diesel process much easier. All of these lines interact with each other, and you can get bigger and bigger returns if you automate several at once!

It is used very often, in various stages of progression, often to make Nitric Acid that is used for Industrial TNT, Cetane-Boosted Diesel and other products. From Fermented Biomass, you can get it directly, although only one tenth of the amount of biomass used, 1000 mL to 100 mL of Ammonia.

The rate at which you're going to get this, just from one HV DT, isn't very fast. DTs are slow by design, and the ratio for Ammonia isn't great, so you can accumulate it if you leave the setup running for a while, but you won't be able to feed it into multiple automations that require it unless you upgrade the DT or make more of them, both of which are easy to do later on. Alternatively, you can choose to void the other outputs and work with singleblock Distilleries instead, but this depends on the rate at which you're inputting saplings.

Unlike in the other steps, you can probably get away with batch crafting this instead of automating it, and still have consistent power from this fuel line. One stack of this dust is enough to make more than 100 million EU's worth of power, as long as the other fluids are automated. Given that, you can forget about it for a long time, but not forever.

SourcingYourWood-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFw==.json,3095,Sourcing Your Wood,"When it comes to power from wood, your only options so far have been the wood itself and Charcoal. Both of these are low on energy per item, so you will need a lot of wood to have a decent EU/t output. How, then, can you easily get that much? There are two ways: the automated way, and the non-automated way.

The automated way can be done with one of several machines, but in LV you only have one option: the LV Crop Manager. It can automatically harvest crops in an area around it and, for this situation, the crop you want is one of several Bonsais. You can get them by planting saplings on cropsticks (there is a lot more information about how crops work in the Forestry and Multifarms page), and most types of saplings are equivalent to one another, although not all of them can be planted as crops. The ones that stand out are Spruce, which give a bit more wood than the others, and Oak, which give Apples alongside the usual wood and saplings, possibly useful for some chemistry later.

The non-automated way can be done earlier, and it only requires two things: an unbreakable Lumber Axe and trees with a lot of wood, like Sacred Oak, Redwood, or Rainforest Oak. This axe will chop down (most of) the trees and award you with stacks and stacks of wood, much faster than the automated way, but with more work.

SuperFuelAndBoil-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQA==.json,3136,Super Fuel And Boiling,"If you've gotten this far, you should be ready to produce Steam at an alarming rate from this hyper-efficient fuel. Unlike Combustion Generators and Gas Turbines, you will need more multis in front of your Large Boiler because it outputs Superheated Steam. More specifically, you will need two turbines: one for turning the Superheated Steam into EU and regular Steam, and another for turning the regular Steam into EU and water, to be reused in the boiler.

The multis will not run without a turbine inside the controller. The size and material of a turbine determines the optimal flow rate and the EU/t at that rate. Good materials in EV are Shadow Metal (from Thaumcraft) and Manyullyn, before upgrading to Oriharukon in IV. Steam turbines usually generate less EU/t than gas turbines but that depends on the amount and tier of the boilers, and whether or not you are using loose mode (check the Steam Turbine quest for more details).

Steam flow rates are very high which means you will need huge GT pipes to keep up, but there is a better way: AE2 P2P tunnels, set to fluid mode, can teleport fluids from one multi to the next without caring for high flow rates.

It's more efficient than burning the Charcoal in a boiler, but you will still need to provide a lot of wood to make sure you have consistent, abundant power. It's heavily recommended that you automate this wood input, if you haven't already, possibly with an MV Crop Manager instead of the LV one, or with the Crop Harvester from IC2. 

For automation, you're still stuck with using bonsais, not regular trees. HV will provide a few options that don't need crops, but for now you might want to increase your crop stats by crossbreeding. Planting saplings on cropsticks creates 1/1/1 bonsais, which are much slower than their high-stat variants. If you want to invest in crops, you can later use the high stats to get more of a several dozen different items that crops can output, but you should start with Stickreed to develop your crop stats, not bonsais.

Instead of just duplicating your existing setup, you can upgrade Biodiesel to Cetane-Boosted Diesel (CBD), with a specific additive called Tetranitromethane (TNM). You'll get more bang for your buck if you upgrade to this fuel, instead of just making more Biodiesel, since it has 3x more EU per bucket, and the TNM is needed in small quantities. Before you start working on the new setup, though, it's important that you increase the amount of Seed/Fish Oil you're making, and in turn the items that turn into those oils. 

As before, you can use IC2 crops, regular crops/trees or fishing. For IC2 crops, you can use the Multifarm set to IC2 crop mode, which needs HV-gated Uranium Electron Tubes but automated more than 1000 crops while being very conservative with power and fertilizer, or the HV Crop Manager. For normal crops/trees, use the EnderIO Farming Station, also unlocked in HV.

The multi in which Nitrobenzene is crafted is the Exxonmobil Chemical Plant, also known as the Chemplant, and it is a gigantic 7x7x7 structure with 4 separate upgradable parts to it. Even worse, the outer structure uses multiblock Machine Casings, making the DT look cheap by comparison, and the inside needs a lot of the casings used to craft single blocks.

The difference between those is that the tier of the outer structure that you need is mentioned in the recipe you want to craft, and the tier of the inner structure is generally related to the EU/t of the recipe, minus one tier. This is because, like the EBF and the LCR, you can use 2 energy hatches, so this HV recipe can be made with MV energy hatches. Since the inner structure's tier decides the max tier of the hatches used in the Chemplant, you can make it out of MV machine casings, which use Aluminium.

The outer structure will still need many stacks of Titanium, so this is where most of your effort will go. Good luck.

To continue using bonsais, in case you have gotten good stats on them, you can use the HV version of the Crop Manager, or the multiblock version, the Multifarm.

Other than these two options, you can also grow and harvest trees normally with the EnderIO Farmer, which is a more typical tree automation machine. It's HV-locked, simple, and reliable and only needs a bit of power to get the wood you need, at a pretty fast rate.

The Garage Door requires a block at the top to hang ""down"" from, but can pretty much be any length.  A redstone signal on any block next to the Garage Door blocks will open or close the door. The open/close will propagate across multiple vertical doors, so you can setup non-square doors. Sneaking and right-clicking with an empty hand will change the door's polarity.

The pressure plates are player-only activation, making them great for doors into your base.

The hatches must be clicked on the side of a block to place. They can be handy for protecting you from crucible...byproducts.
 
There is a lot more block shapes possible, check NEI for ""Carpenter's"" to see the options.

The Chisel allows you to chisel blocks while attached to a Carpenter's block.

The Hammer allows various functions.

Catwalks-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM3g==.json,3294,Catwalks,"The Catwalks Mod adds several cosmetic blocks to deck out your factory.

Scaffolds and Builder's Scaffolds are useful for building up in the air before you get access to flight. They can be climbed like ladders, and break instantly when punched. You will also not fall off of them if you let go of movement keys while climbing. If you right-click the Builder's Scaffold with a solid block, the scaffold will be replaced by that block.

Catwalks can connect to each other to form a wide passageway. You can decorate them by attaching Caution Tape or Rope Lights, the latter provide dim lighting.

Caged Ladders give you a way to move up and down without a risk of falling off. Climbing them is much faster than vanilla ladders.

Support Columns are purely decorative. They connect to each other in all directions. They also work as ladders.

Sturdy Rails let you run minecart tracks across gaps without supports. Right-click the Sturdy Powered Rail with a Blowtorch to power it permanently, you don't need a redstone torch. If you don't have enough distractions already, use them to build a rollercoaster!

The Blowtorch lets you remove railings or even the floor from a catwalk by right-clicking. Use it to make an opening to let you walk onto the catwalk, or if you don't know what an ""OSHA violation"" is. The same function can be performed by a GT or Forge-compatible wrench, so you don't actually need to make this.

[note]Our journey reaches the current end, entering the UXV, aka EOH era.

The year is 2023, and the game continues to be pushed further and further. The EOH exists now, along with machine parts up to UXV. Multiblocks have gained endless amounts of quality of life, including sub 1-tick OC, batch mode, void protection, and numerous AE2 additions like Crafting Input Buses, Stocking Hatches, Level Maintainers and more. Automation has never been easier, yet the goal has never been placed farther. Naquadah Fuel now has many tiers and can compete into the late-game, even competing with (now fixed) Dyson, but outclassed by the huge amount of power a maximized EOH can make (12.8 TEU/t!).

Initially the stargate recipe seemed impossible, requiring months of runtime on hundreds of maximized EOHs, requiring some adjustments to be more realistic to attain. After this was changed, the race began again, this time between §aJohny709§r and §aGDCloud§r. §aJohny§r burned out towards the end, and §aGDCloud§r was surpassed by a silent contender, §aStarStack§r, being the first to conquer this challenge on the §a26th of June, 2023§r.

Beyond just the first, this era marked the beginning of the Group Run Era, with large runs such as §aBallers Run§r (setting this era into motion), §aBee Run§r (affecting wide change on the NH project and its management as a whole), and §aCell Run 2§r (the fastest ever Stargate run, in only 73 days, popularizing many automation techniques like Level Maintained lines).

Additionally, this version saw the first player achieve GTNH Gods, reaching Stargate in a 3rd run, earned by §aGDCloud§r as a part of §aCell Run 2§r on the §a23rd of June, 2024§r. Later this Stargate would see three others reach this goal, §aRamspace§r on the §a29th of September, 2024§r, and §aStaffiX§r and §aserenibyss§r in a group run on the §a17th of November, 2024§r.

AnalyzeYourCrops-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGBQ==.json,1541,Analyze Your Crops,"The cropnalyzer is a powered tool used to analyze IC2 crop seedbags. Charge it by placing it in an MV machine; recommended to put an MV battery in it as well to keep it full. To fully analyze a seed bag, you will need to put it through the cropnalyzer four times. If the crop is already planted, it is better to analyze it with the portable scanner instead of breaking it just to scan it - you have a chance of losing the seed every time you break it.

The cropnalyzer also has a feature called the IC2 Crop Calculator, where you can find the mix of outputs of breeding together any crops. To access the calculator, hit the IC2 side inventory key while holding the cropnalyzer.  You can select any crops available and discover what plants have decent percentages of a result. And no, you can't do the reverse, search for the crops.zip on discord for that (it doesn't have micadia though).

You can choose up to four crops to breed together. Then click ""process"" and the bottom row will show the possible crossbreeding outputs, and their weights. You can use the + and - gui buttons to scroll through the row(s) of crops. You can also use a button in the GUI to sort the rows by tier or weight. You can invert the sorting by hitting the sorting button while holding shift.

When trying to get a specific crop, you generally want to maximize its percentage. Do this by breeding 2-4 of the same plant together (more is faster). There is no advantage to crossing plant types, it just reduces the % chance of getting what you want, contrary to what you might think.

Use the crops guide at [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/IC2_Crops_List[/url] for more details.

A large field of stickreeds has a good chance at making lots of valuable crosses. This is because it's decently high tier (they randomly mutate to tiers nearby mostly), and it's really fast, so you can get it to a high stat fast, which you should probably do first. Mutations are random, you can get transformium from stickreed, so keep that in mind. You do tend to get similar crops, so if you want metals, get the metal crops for example. Go to the wiki or spreadsheet (not up to date) to see the attributes that govern similarity.",作物分析仪,"[721, 103]",分析你的作物,"作物分析仪是一种电动工具,用于分析IC2作物种子袋.可将其放入MV机器来充电;建议直接将MV电池放入其中以保持电力充足(译者注:其实你放个兰波顿也没问题).要完全分析种子袋,你需要使用作物分析仪分析四次.如果已经种植了作物,最好用便携式扫描仪进行分析,可比作物分析仪好用多了--而且每次左键作物架都有可能丢失种子.作物分析仪还有一个名为IC2作物计算器的功能,你可以在其中找到任何作物的杂交输出组合.要使用计算器,请在手持作物分析仪的同时按""IC2 side inventory""键(默认为C,可在控制中更改).潜行时也可以这样做,会有一个不同的GUI,这时你可以选择任何作物而不需要从你的背包中使用它们. 你可以选择想要的作物,然后查看如何杂交有较高的几率.不过无法反向查看,要知道这个,请在discord上查找crops.zip(不过没有云母作物(micadia)).在任一GUI中,你最多可以选择四个作物一起杂交.然后单击""process"",底部一行将显示可能的杂交输出及其几率(并非百分比).你可以使用""+""和""-""按钮滚动作物的行.你还可以使用GUI中右下的按钮按作物等级(tier)、名字(name)或几率(priority)对输出行进行排序.你可以在按住shift的同时按下排序按钮来反转排序.当你尝试获取特定的作物时,你通常希望最大化其几率.但更具体地说,你希望在所有可能中最大化其几率比例.这意味着用不同作物一起杂交通常没有任何好处,这只会降低你想要的那种作物的生成几率,所以用2-4株同种作物杂交吧.关于作物杂交,这里有一篇教程https://tinyurl.com/GTNH-Crops  一大片粘性甘蔗田可以杂交出许多有价值的作物.因为粘性甘蔗的作物等级较高(大多数情况下的随机变异等级变化不大),而且粘性甘蔗生长速度很快,这样很容易就可以把三围刷上去,这是杂交试验田的第一步. 变异是随机的,别忘了粘性甘蔗可以杂交出UU作物(transformium).杂交会倾向于变异成类似的作物,所以如果你需要金属,那就多杂交点金属作物. 请到Wiki或表格(非最新)上查看作物的具体属性."

Items stored in storages like the cabinet (or your inventory) can be used in recipes. All storage spaces for items are the same, so don't bother making a ton of fridges unless you really want to. Supply water to the sink to get water for recipes.

You can store some cooking tools in the oven. You can store the rest on tool racks to auto-use them all in recipes. This includes stuff like the GT soft mallet if you can't make all the Pam's tools yet.

The oven has 3 input slots and 3 output slots, and can work on 9 items at once. It's basically a furnace. You can request items be cooked from the cooking table too.

The Cooking Table will automatically show you all recipes that can be created with the existing ingredients, and you can click on them to craft them. Make all the food, and get all the hearts!

You can use dye to color the kitchen, except for the oven.

Note that the implementation is not finished, so there are some problems. Upgrades like powering the oven with RF/EU are not in yet. And so on. But we finally have a toaster so you can make TOAST!

It also stays scanned after getting the seed. Look for the portable scanner quest after the EBF in Multiblock Goals. About those stats:

§aGrowth§r:
How fast it grows, with higher = faster. Specifically, it increases the growth points your crop gets per growth tick. If it gets to 24+, your crop acts like a weed, so most people say to stay at 23 or less. However, it will only weed other crops under certain conditions.

1) Is in a cardinal direction on the same Y level. 2) Will only affect dirt/grass, or cropsticks or crops 3) If there's a crop there that is §oalso§r a weed, if it's at a maturity level > 1, it §owon't affect it§r 4) If it affects the crop, it'll be replaced with a normal weed

§9Gain§r:
Influences chances of how many drops you get, and whether you get any at all. 31 is the best for sure.

§eResistance§r:
This stat is responsible for a couple of crops' properties: chances for getting a seed while punching crop, resistance of your crop to trampling (jumping on it), decreases chance of crop dying due to lack of enviromental stats, and resistance of crop to weed spread. It also reduces mutation chance as it goes up (apparently).

EvenMoreStats-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK0Q==.json,2769,Even More Stats,"There's seven more stats to worry about too.

§7Fertilizer§r, §9Water§r, and [warn]Weed-EX[/warn] are all about how much of these is on the crop stick rather than the crop itself. They're all about how much was applied, and is left of that.

§2Nutrients§r, §1Humidity§r, and §6Air Quality§r are all about the environment. They're also affected by the Fertilizer and Water stats.

Nutrients and Humidity are mostly about the right biome, with swamp and rainforest types (hot+humid) being the best, but you can also get some extra stats by setting up right.

§2Nutrients§r:
3 possible free points from dirt under the farmland block, 2 for plants that require a specific block. So optimally always make sure that the required block is at the bottommost bottom in the column, because it checks in chain, not certain height. For example: cropstick -> farmland -> dirt -> oreblock -> dirt, it will only register 1 dirt, ignoring the one below the oreblock.

5-10 possible points from fertilizing your crops. You can use fertilizer on a crop to increase its nutrients stat. Fertilizer caps at 199 which gives 10 nutrients, but can be applied again only if the crop drops below 100 fertilizer points. So for high stat crops its safe to assume and make tests for 100 fertilizer points as its a given constant unlike 199->100 values. You can apply bonemeal, IC2 fertilizer and Forestry fertilizer to a crop by hand. Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron does this automatically when supplied with fertilizer (the multifarm needs fertilizer to harvest crops as well).

§1Humidity§r:
2 free points from using dirt as farmland, as when farmland gets hydrated by water(turns darker) it gains 2 humidity points. This is why other blocks for this suck, since they don't give this bonus.

10 possible points from hydrating your crop. Similiar to fertilizing, water can be applied to crop up to 200 points, which is 10 humidity points, altough unlike fertilizer it does not need to drop below value of 100, water can be applied over and over keeping it at constant 200 points. You can apply water to your crop by using IC2 hydration cells by hand, or let your Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron do it automatically. The multifarm needs water to harvest crops as well though.

§6Air Quality§r:
4 potential free points from empty space around crop. A crop checks for empty spaces to calculate bonus air quality points, it gives up to 4 points, 1 point for each 2 empty spaces. It only counts full blocks or cropsticks though. If you like looks, you'll probably have to sacrifice this.

4 free points from height of your farm. You get 1 free point every 15 blocks startng at Y79.
79 - 1 point
94 - 2 points
109 - 3 points
124 - 4 points

2 free points from no opaque blocks above the crop. You can place glass above and you won't lose the bonus since it's a transparent block. You cannot use dark glass, several layers of water, or gaseous tenebrae to get around this if your crop likes the dark. Unless you only let it grow at night I guess.

§aGrowability§r:
Your crop will require a certain level of NHA, try to reach or surpass this, or the crop will either not grow, or even die (disappear). Each crop is different, and higher tiers (and stats) require more. It's generally easy to meet though, as long as you're in a good biome.

Growability is determined by the difference between what the crop needs in terms of NHA, and what it actually has. If you have more than what you need it grows faster. This is why you don't want a maxed resistance stat, since higher stats will slow it down.",进阶扫描仪 IV,[1794],更多状态数据,"还需要考虑另外七个状态.肥料(Fertilizer)、水分(Water)、和除草剂(Weed-EX)这三个状态值更多反应的是作物架而非作物本身的状态.反应的都是使用了/剩下了多少肥料/水分/除草剂.养分(Nutrients)、湿度(Humidity)、和空气质量(Air-Quality)这三个状态都是关于环境的.且它们还受肥料和水分状态的影响.养分和湿度与生物群系的关系最大,沼泽(swamp)和雨林(rainforest)生物群系最佳(炎热+潮湿),不过你也可以通过正确的设置获得额外的状态加成.养分:农田下方的泥土方块有3点加成,作物所需的特定方块有2点加成.所以,最佳做法是将所需特定方块置于泥土链的最下方,因为作物判定环境时是按照链式检测的,并非检测特定高度. 举个例子:作物架->田->泥土->矿石->泥土,这样的排列只会计算1块泥土的养分值,矿石下方的泥土将被忽略.作物上所施的肥料会决定5-10点养分值.即可通过施肥提高其养分值.199点肥料值可获得10点养分值加成,但只有在作物肥料值低于100时才能再次施肥(这也是养分值5-10浮动的原因).所以对于高级作物而言,计算养分值时请以100点肥料值为基准,而不要用199点肥料值这一极限加成.骨粉、IC2肥料、林业肥料都可用于施肥.为林业农场(果园模式)或作物监管机提供肥料都可以实现自动施肥(林业农场收割作物时也需要肥料).湿度:当泥土耕地被水湿润(变黑)时,可提供2点湿度值加成.而其他方块作为农田无法享受此加成.作物的水分值可提供10点湿度值.这与肥料值类似,作物最高200点水分值可提供10点湿度值;而不同的是水分值可以不断补充保持200这一峰值,而不用等到低于100,所以水分值提供的湿度值一般稳定10点.手持IC2水化单元可以浇水,而林业农场和作物监管机也可以实现自动化灌溉.不过林业农场收割作物时也需要水.空气质量:作物周围的8格空间,决定了4点空气质量值加成.一株作物会检测周围8格是否为完整方块或其他作物,如果不是,那么每两处空间将提供1点空气质量值加成,最高4点.一般来说这4点或多或少会有部分牺牲,无法拿全.农田高度也决定了4点空气质量值.从Y=79开始,每提高15格可获得1点空气质量值.79-1点94-2点109-3点124-4点作物上方是否有不透明方块决定了2点空气质量值加成.上方的玻璃不会影响此加成,因为玻璃是透明方块.但深色玻璃、几层水或暗影气瓶都会影响此空气质量值.除非你让作物只在晚上生长,否则对喜暗作物一般无法获得此空气质量值加成.生长点(Growability):作物会要求某一具体的养分/湿度/空气质量,努力达到或超过这一要求吧,否则作物就无法生长,甚至可能死亡(消失).每株作物的要求都不同,越高级的作物要求越高(同种作物三围越高的要求也越高).只要你处于不错的生物群系,这一环境要求一般很容易达到.生长点的累积速度由实际环境值与作物要求环境值之间的差距决定.实际环境值越高累积越快.这也是为什么我们不想要满抗性值的作物,因为高属性的作物会提高要求的环境值,相应的会降低生长点累积的速度."

Testing has shown that splitting the amps to 4 gearboxes (4A ULV) works better than sending 1A LV to 4 gearboxes.

Sending more power to the same gearbox doesn't work. If it can get to max RF capacity but your farm can't keep up, sending more power won't help, so add more gearboxes.

In addition, you lose 2 EU from the the energy emitting device for every A of ULV (which is only 8 to begin with), so it's not nearly as efficient as using LV or higher. Just keep in mind that more A to more gearboxes is better than to the same one.

Full details on how to use these may require online research (GTNH changes the recipes, not normal Railcraft functionality), but here is a simple list of things to do:

1. Make a loop of track from your base to the oil well.

3. Use the tank car on the filter in the loader and set it to Immediate mode.
4. Connect the well to the loader as normal.
5. Put a fluid unloader under a locking track at your base, and set it the same as the loader.
6. Automate the locomotive similarly - a fluid loader above a steam locomotive set to manual and filtered to the locomotive.

Either you got it working, you need to do more research, you realized it moves 32 buckets a trip and decided to just walk, or you can go to Discord and ask why anyone would build a train.

The way to make enhanced pearls is to right click with End Powder in your hand to modify your ender pearl. You can continue adding as many effects to one pearl as you want.

These effects are useful when throwing the pearl, for pearl teleportation effects.

Natural occurence:
It is possible to find pearls with random effects in a Dungeon Tower's loot chests.

Enhancements:
No fall damage (Wool)
Upon the pearl's landing, the player will not receive any fall damage.

No gravity (Feather)
The pearl will not follow the rules of gravity, which makes it possible to throw it straight up. After 10 seconds of flight, the pearl is automatically destroyed without any teleportation or fall damage.

Increased range (String)
Unlike the no gravity effect, the pearl will fall down due to gravity, but will do so 25% slower. If the pearl has the no gravity effect too, it will override this effect.

Double speed (Gold Nugget)
Increases the pearl's speed by a factor of 2, but won't change the flight trajectory. This can be helpful if you are in a bad situation (fell in lava, swarm of mobs around...) and need to be saved very quickly. In combination with the riding effect, you may notice slight stuttering on a server.

Explosive (Gunpowder)
Upon landing, the pearl will explode with radius of 2.7 (TNT has radius of 4). This will not harm the thrower as long as they are far enough from the landing spot.

Freeze (Snowball) 
The pearl will freeze mobs and players within 5 blocks of the landing spot for at least 4 seconds. Just as with the explosive effect, this will not affect the thrower unless they throw the pearl close to them, or have the riding effect applied. This effect is also followed by ice cracking sound and snow particles.

Riding (Lead)

Simply by standing on the End Stone Terrain, the infestation level will rise. After leaving the area for several minutes, if the infestation level is low, it will reset and won't do any harm to the player.

However, if the infestation level gets high enough, it will trigger one or more potion effects, which include weakness, slowness and mining fatigue, and if the player's level is severe, blindness, confusion and/or poison may take place as well.

Certain bees will not produce their specialty items unless they are Jubilant. This requires matching their preferred Temperature/Humidity, without any genetic modifiers. Some bees also need a block of something beneath them as well.

Using the unbreakable stability of Proto-Halkonite, harnessing the power of [warn]Chaos[/warn] becomes a reality. The  Semi-Stable Antimatter Stabilization Sequencer introduces the concept of Semi-Stable Antimatter, created from Protomatter.

But it’s a cruel mistress... fail to manage it, and antimatter could void itself into nothingness.

The Semi-Stable Antimatter is produced in 1 second cycles, the amount generated is based on the total of antimatter currently stocked in it's 16 Antimatter Hatches and consumes equal amounts of Proto Matter.

The average change in Antimatter is equal to (§3Antimatter Total§r)^§6§n0.5§r * N(§c§n0.2§r, 0.25), where N is a Gaussian Distribution, meaning the total antimatter change may be negative.

The Produced Antimatter is distributed between the 16 hatches, sampled from N(§c§n0.2§r, 1). This causes an imbalance between the hatches. To properly automate the antimatter production, it's vital to always re-balance the amount of antimatter in the hatches. At the end of each cycle, the lowest amount of antimatter present in hatches is recorded, and any hatch that contains more than the lowest amount loses half the difference!

Proper use of stabilization fluids can significantly reduce energy usage and boost production:

It consumes 10,000,000 + (§3Antimatter§r * 1000)^§2§n1.5§r EU/t passively
Magnetic Stabilization Fluids can mitigate the passive instability and have it's §2exponent§e§r reduced:
Molten Purified Tengam Exponent = §2§n1.35§r
Tachyon-Rich Fluid Exponent = §2§n1.2§r

For each cycle, the SSASS uses (§3Antimatter§r * 10000)^§5§n1.5§r EU
By regulating the gravity containment of the forge, this §5exponent§r can also be reduced:
Molten Spacetime Exponent = §5§n1.45§r
Spatially Enlarged Fluid Exponent = §5§n1.40§r
Molten Eternity Exponent = §5§n1.35§r

By containing the antimatter more compactly, it is possible to generate larger gains per cycle. Containment Stabilization fluids alter the §6exponent§r in the production formula:
Molten Shirabon Exponent = §6§n0,55§r
Molthen MHDSCM Exponent = §6§n0,60§r

By inserting fluids with high energy potential, it's possible to alter antimatter's flow in chaos, making their randomness more favorable. Activation Stabilization Fluids alter the §cskew§r of the gaussian distribution, lowering the risks of negative changes in antimatter and favoring better gains.

The material you need here is Arcanite, one you probably have used before. This step requires you to preferably automate it with ABS, and have a steady supply of Thorium 232.

Each turbine material has a specific fuel efficiency (the higher, the more EU you get from the same amount of fuel), and the multi only reaches this efficiency if the fuel flow into it matches the optimal flow.

If you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier.

[quest]Introducing the Shielded Lagrangian Annihilation Matrix![/quest]

The SLAM creates raw energy by reacting the Semi-Stable Antimatter with normal matter in a controlled environment.

Every cycle, the generator will react all antimatter and matter in hatches instantly, converting it all into energy directly. The EU output is based on the equal amounts of antimatter and matter annihilated. Therefore, imbalance between the amounts will waste your precious energy.

Depending on the matter used to annihilate, the antimatter amount gets an exponent applied to it, directly increasing the amount of energy produced from 1L of antimatter - this means the more you annihilate in one go, the more efficient it is!

The maximum EU for a cycle is limited by the capacity of all laser source hatches on the structure (limited to 64), even on wireless mode.

[note]It can't output more than 9.22e18 EU in a cycle, or just below 43 16M UXV Laser Sources (If you're crazy enough for it)

Illteachyouhowto-Hn_igsosSbKsnATeYgvPgw==.json,-6008922449644892285,I'll teach you... how to Praise the Sun!,"TL;DR: The casing amount in this quest is for the best Solar Tower, which generates around 2 LuV amps and is a major Stainless Steel, Titanium and HV circuit sink, amongst other things.

Have you ever laid eyes upon a solar panel? You might have built a few of them here. What do they all have in common, I ask you... they generate either Steam or EU directly from sunlight, and that is not efficient. There's something that everybody forgot!

Singleblock solar panels are best to insert anywhere that has sun, and provide constant power to a machine. However, EU storage and transport are easy here, so why not build something better? Instead of generating energy directly, send those warm beams of sunlight into a central structure with circles of Solar Reflectors, and bask in the eternal power of the biggest fusion reactor in the Solar System!

(If you end up making a bigger one, don't come arguing to me about this. Be quiet.)

The whole idea is that the energy of the Sun's rays is directed towards a fluid that can retain the energy, a Solar Salt that does it far better than water. The Solar Tower transfers heat to all the fluid inside it, but watch out! If there's too much cold Solar Salt inside, it will drain away all the heat and slow down the entire process.

In more detail, the Solar Tower has a heat value that ranges from 0 to 100000, and it only heats up Solar Salt at 30000 or above. The amount of heat gained per cycle depends on the number of Reflectors, but also the current heat value: this process is optimal at exactly half the maximum, so 50000 heat. To get a perfect tower setup, you have to slowly feed cold Solar Salt to maintain this heat value, taking away just enough heat to keep it there. I'll let you figure out what the flow rate is, given that it depends on how many Reflectors you have.

From there, generate Steam or SH Steam by heat-exchanging in the same way as Hot Coolant does it. If you want this setup to truly be optimal, do place it in your personal dimension for permanent daylight.",太阳能塔,[1416],,

This engine consumes all fuel and combustion promoter in its input hatches per second and outputs power depending on the amount of fuel consumed, and its fuel value.

Its efficiency is determined by the Combustion Promoter/Fuel ratio. If the ratio is larger (there is more promoter), the efficiency will be higher. The max efficiency is 150%, but you cannot achieve this value without inputting an infinite amount of promoter. Expect efficiencies around 130% for high fuel value fuels like High-Octane Gasoline, unless you spend a LOT of promoter.

e.g. You input 100mB/s of HOG and 1000mB/s of combustion promoter. The efficiency is 149% and the sum of the HOG fuel value is 250000 EU.

If you've unlocked fusion, you can start this questline, but keep in mind that it's divided into three segments (the three fusion chains): one for each tier of Fusion Reactor, from Mk1 to Mk3.

There is a spreadsheet for all these chains, although it has some reactor count numbers that aren't right. To see it, check the Excel spreadsheet that set these numbers, in the following Github link:[url]https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GTplusplus/pull/669[/url]

These quests follow the process of creating some truly powerful plasmas that are useful for power generation at the beginning of endgame, when you've scaled up your setup to a Compact Fusion Reactor and XL Plasma Turbines. As you might have seen before, those huge turbines can go very fast with good materials, like Trinium or Infinity, but they will apply EU/t penalties according to the fuel value of the plasma used. This means that Helium and Tin Plasma are both much weaker there than they were in Large Plasma Turbines.

The end product of this whole process is Celestial Tungsten Plasma, which has no penalties even at Spacetime and can somewhat match what Helium Plasma would have produced, per compact reactor. The last step is the slowest, but, if there are no other bottlenecks, you can expect around §2§lover 8 billion EU/t§r assuming a single compact doing the last step with huge infinity turbines in a plasma XL.

However, getting there won't be easy. This whole process uses 15 fusion recipes in total, and a lot more material automation than any of the simple fusion setups.

WeNeedBigToys-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDw==.json,783,§6§lWe Need Big Toys,"All your little turbines take up too much space? Are you running out of water? It's time to solve these problems. This Large Steam Turbine can help you produce a tremendous amount of energy. It will also distill water for you, so you can use the same water again inside your Large Boiler. Don't forget to make a rotor for the turbine and put inside the controller, otherwise this multiblock won't do anything.

Each turbine has a specific optimal flow, the Steam flow that gives the highest fuel efficiency, the value shown on the turbine's tooltip. This is the flow you want to match, and you can use a Fluid Regulator as a cover to make it exactly what you want, but you can go beyond this flow to get an even higher EU/t value, at a loss of fuel efficiency. You can make turbines in 4 different sizes, with larger turbines producing more EU/t, but with variying amounts of fuel efficiency. Generally, Large is the best due to having the highest fuel efficiency and a good optimal flow rate

When using turbines, be careful of flow rates. To find the optimal flow rate, you divide the optimal energy flow rate listed on the turbine, by the energy value for the plasma. You can also use the Large Turbine Calculator (there's a link on the main spreadsheet, which is linked to in discord), or scan the multiblock's controller while feeding it a minimal amount of plasma to see what the optimal flow is. Make sure to use a Fluid Regulator set to this flow rate for highest fuel efficiency, or go beyond it to get more EU/t at a cost to efficiency, with Steam Turbines being the worst at retaining efficiency beyond the optimal flow.

If you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 150% of optimal flow to produce 112% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 200% of optimal flow to produce 133% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 250% of optimal flow to produce 156% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away. Don't exceed your dynamo hatch's maximum EU/t output, though, or you will have problems!

Turbines with a small turbine durability below 75k have their recipes removed. Use NEI with the appropriate long rod to find assembler recipes that will work for you. Or the spreadsheet. Long magnalium for small turbines, long titanium for normal turbines, etc.

Pre-moon, the best rotors are Shadow Metal or Vibrant Alloy.

Post-moon, the best HV rotors are Shadow Metal or Oriharukon (this is IV-tier). Luckily, turbines are now fully functional with multi-amp dynamos, so give those a try if you need extra amps!

This turbine, unlike the others, has very important differences to the regular multi that you have to keep in mind. Given that plasma power is so easy to upscale with the use of compact reactors, XL Plasma Turbines would have to follow suit and bring progression's EU numbers to ridiculous degrees, off one single plasma. However, this XL now applies an EU/t penalty to its production by comparing the fuel value of the plasma it processes with the rotor material it has inside.

See [url]https://i.imgur.com/vifsk0P.png[/url] for various combinations of plasmas and materials. Mk1 plasmas are in green, Mk2 in yellow and Mk3 in red. The bottom 3 are the final plasmas of the fusion chains.

The formula is a bit complicated, but here are some important values:

-> Helium Plasma receives a huge penalty of 86.1% even with Infinity Catalyst, whereas Tin's penalty is only 53.5%, which means that the number of reactors and XLs with this material is twice the expected amount if using Tin Plasma;
-> Trinium changes these numbers to 92.4% and 74.5%, respectively;
-> Infinity further increases the penalty to 97.4% and 91.1%;
-> Spacetime sets these values to 98.3% and 94.4%.

This means that, at the UHV/UEV stage, you will no longer be able to rely on these two plasmas with your XLs. For 1-recipe plasmas, your best option is the mk3 Americium Plasma, which has an insignificant 0.8% penalty with Infinity.

The main purpose of the dagger is to collect specialist ingredients used in witchcraft, and to this end it will dramatically improve the chance of a mob dropping such ingredients (e.g. Wool of Bat, Tongue of Dog, etc.). It also gives a small chance of undead dropping Spectral Dust.

When only using vanilla Minecraft with Witchery (and no other mods), an Arthana dagger is the only way to get a skull to drop when a skeleton is killed, the drop chance is about 5% (the skull is a key upgrade for an altar). The dagger even gives a very small probability for other head drops (from mobs and players). All drop chances are increased with the Looting enchantment.

FlameImp-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJKw==.json,2347,Flame Imp,"Flame Imps are demons strongly associated with fiery magic.

Not as physically strong as their dimmer cousins, Flame Imps are mischievous creatures who are very easily swayed with the promise of personal gain. They may even be bound into the service of a witch (or warlock) if the offer is good enough.

Flame Imps are summoned using a Rite of Summoning, and they are most likely to attack the first person they see. It is advisable to make a deal with them quickly.

Making a deal

To bind a Flame Imp into service, a witch must write the agreement into a Demonic Contract and sign it with their own blood (craft with a Taglock Kit). 
This contract must then be given to the Flame Imp, who will require a down-payment of Experience Levels (typically 25).

Once a deal is struck, the imp will be bound to the location of the deal, not able to wander too far away. The Imp will attack anyone hostile to its master.

Imps like receiving valuable gifts, once suitably impressed an imp may be prepared to perform various flame related spells at the request of their master.

Spells take the form of contracts describing what must be done and to whom. 
Simply craft a Demonic Contract with the necessary components and then the resulting contract with a taglock. 
Then give the contract to the Imp. So long as the creature is in the same dimension, the magic will take hold.

A Flame imp may also occasionally give a gift in return for being given valuable things. These have been known to include the souls of demons that can be consumed to allow a witch to cast demonic spells. 

A very well treated Flame Imp may even yield knowledge to summon a Lord of Torment.

The means to control the dead -> Necromantic Stone
The beating means to master the infernal dimension -> Demon Heart
I must perform many curses, bring me the necessary brew -> Brew of the Grotesquex5
I desire to predict the future -> Crystal Ball
Or just fight something.

Once completed, they'll disappear until you need them. They will sometimes appear near your spawn point if you walk by it, so don't position it over lava or something, since they CAN die and reduce the number of your coven. You can have 6, with one extra appearing for Cauldron work. Consider keeping some extras around in a dungeon just in case.

After you recruit your coven, you just need a few things for the ritual itself: Spider Eye, Toe of Frog, Wool of Bat, Tongue of Dog, Owlet's Wing, Attuned Stone, and Attuned Stone (Charged).

To specify the biome, look in the Book of Biomes, and find 1) the type (Forest, Plains, etc), and 2) the number. Type determines the foci used, and number determines the amount of Glowstone Dust used to get that specific biome. Make sure to pack up a ritual circle into a circle talisman so you don't have to redraw it, and bring some cobblestone to make a flat area (15x15, any height). Try not to do it at night unless you like dealing with infernals.

To actually do the ritual, have the ritual circle on the ground, the items (including the foci and Glowstone) in the circle, and right-click the center with the Seer's Stone.

The area affected is determined by the number of witches in your coven. It's 16 * (size of coven - 3) radius in a circular area, so 16/32/48 if it doesn't fail.

Unfortunately, sometimes after logging out and back in again you may find that it didn't work correctly in specific chunks, this is (possibly) due to lack of chunk updates and it not saving the changed biome ID correctly. Just redoing the ritual doesn't really help, you'll just get patches in the same places, however placing water after the ritual and before logging out may help with this. Or use chickens. Lots of chickens.

Also, if you already have crops in the area, they'll disappear until a block update or relog.

Firstly, a fire must be set under the kettle (netherrack is best for this, but wood will do just as well). 

Next the kettle must be filled. You can use pipes to automate this. 

Thirdly, each of the six ingredients for the brew or infusion must be thrown into the kettle, one at a time (the liquid will change color according to the recipe being used). 

Finally, a glass bottle must be used on the kettle to bottle the resulting brew, this must be done multiple times depending on the recipe.

It is important to keep the fire going constantly while the recipe is being prepared, otherwise it will be ruined. Swirls coming from the kettle is a sign all is well, black smoke (and brown liquid) indicates the brew is ruined. When a brew is ruined, the kettle must be emptied with a glass bottle, or just filled with more water, and the whole process repeated.

When a brew is complete, the liquid will be the color of the resulting brew and will splutter (in addition to white swirls).

Some recipes will require magical energy from a nearby Altar before they are bottled. If the brew is bottled when insufficient energy is available, the brew will be ruined.

It will start processing once the input bus contents align with any stored data stick. The first slice will consume the input in Bus #1. After (recipe time/number of inputs) time, the first slice's work is concluded and will start the second slice. At the same time, first slice will look for input in input bus #1. If there are still enough input there slice #1 will start working again.

The terminal slice (the n-th slice, where n is number of item input in recipe) will put the recipe output in output bus when it has concluded his work. Whenever a non-terminal slice finished its work, it will try to pass the work onto next slice. If the next slice cannot find the materials in its input bus, the just-finished slice will remain in [warn]STUCK[/warn] state and hang the assembly line. To help locate these [warn]STUCK[/warn] assembly lines, the controller's front face will have its status light turned orange.

The EU/t cost of this machine is number of slices active multiplied by the original recipe EU/t. [warn]STUCK[/warn] slices do not consume power.

The Tree Growth Simulator can farm almost any tree in the game, and produces all the items you would get by chopping it down normally. All this in a compact 3x3x3 cube, without any lag from growing a real tree.

First, place any sapling in the controller slot of the multiblock. Then, insert tools appropriate to the part of the tree you want to harvest in an input bus. Give the machine power, turn it on, and be ready to get flooded by the outputs.

Different tools are required to gather different parts of the tree:
 - Saw for logs
 - Branch Cutter for saplings
 - Shears for leaves
 - Knife for fruit
Better versions of the tools (Chainsaw, Grafter, ...) will increase the yield! Check the tooltip of the controller block for details.

You can even use multiple different tools together, and the machine will harvest several different products at the same time!

Note that the tools used will slowly lose durability, so for long-term operation you might want to set up some automatic replacement.

§9§r- a normal mode, where one chunk is processed at a time in the working area, in order, per pollution cleaning cycle.
- a random mode, where the chunk being cleaned is picked randomly between all the polluted chunks in the working area.
§r
To cycle between the modes, right click on the controller with a screwdriver.

§9§rThe controller can change its working area from 1x1 to (2*tier+1) x (2*tier+1) chunks. To do that, right click with a screwdriver on the controller while sneaking. The default size is the maximum working area.

§r§9§rThe pollution removal calculation is equals (by default) to 30 * bonusMultiTier * Muffler Hatches * Turbine Eff * Multiblock Eff * 2.5 ^ Effective Tier where:

- BonusMultiTier is a boost given by the multiblock tier. T1 is 1 (0%), T2 is 1.05 (5%) and T3 is 1.10 (10%)

- Muffler Hatches is the amount of muffler hatches on the multiblock (up to 8)

- Turbine Eff is the efficiency of the turbine chosen to run the multi. It won't run if there is no turbine in the controller.

- Multiblock Eff is the efficiency of the multiblock (100% when no maintenance issue, -10% per issue)

- Effective Tier is the Effective Tier of the multi: the minimum tier between the electric tier of the multi and the tier of the muffler hatches

§rThe pollution cleaning is boosted by two (by default) when using an Absorption Filter. When added in the input bus, it will be consumed and used for 30 (by default) successful pollution cleaning cycle. If a chunk with no pollution in it is processed, that doesn't count as successful, and the multi decides that a chunk has no pollution if the pollution is below 10k gibbl (by default). After the 30th successful pollution cleaning cycle, the output bus will give a Dirty Absorption Filter.

If you've ever wanted to generate many chemicals from a single source, you've probably looked at Oil or Benzene. However there's also the Algae Farm. It's just a pond of sorts, so it doesn't need power to run. Since it also doesn't really follow normal recipes, you won't find any NEI recipe page for the Algae. The multi just produces them on a regular schedule.

The tier of the multi is given by the casings on the bottom layer of the multi, which all have to match to decide the tier. Each tier from ULV (starting at 50s per batch) till IV (which is 25s per batch) reduces the time it takes to produce Algae by about 5 seconds, and then beyond that each tier will cut the speed in half. The cases will currently work up to UHV cases, and casings beyond that will not work with this machine. Randomly the production speed can either double or triple the time it takes as well, but this happens relatively rarely.

Each tier increase also adds to the amount of Algae you get in a single cycle, as well as the type of Algae produced. Each cycle gives out an exact amount as well as a bonus amount 10% of the time. The Algae Farm also accepts Compost, that you can make from the algae itself, to boost the multi's tier by one. This might be expensive at the start, but it's heavily recommended in most cases. You can get regular Algae and Green Algae starting at ULV, Brown Algae starts appearing at HV, Golden-Brown Algae at EV, and Red Algae at IV, though most of the cases where they start appearing they start doing so in very small quantities.

To find out more about the exact output quantities and timings, please see the wiki: [url]https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Algae_Farm[/url]

The Algae can be used for various chemicals like Methane, Ammonia, Sulfuric Acid, Sodium Carbonate, Ethylene, Lithium Chloride, and even some power-generating fluids. You typically need a Chemical Plant for that. In IV tier you can also combine Green Algae with Glowstone to get Glowing Coral and make Sunnarium from that.

CatalyzingMiracl-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2Q==.json,3289,Catalyzing Miracles,"The QFT uses the kind of catalyst that the Chemical Plant also does. However, like the plants that have Awakened Draconium coils or higher, it does not consume the catalyst’s durability on recipe finish, behaving more like a real-life catalyst that is regenerated after being used. This makes the catalysts used here more expensive to craft, as was the case with the Infinite Mutation Catalyst for Mutated Living Solder, which is meant to be used only with those coils that make it last forever.

Given that there is no durability loss, it would seem only one catalyst needs to be crafted. However, there are two reasons for this to not be true: firstly, each QFT recipe uses a different catalyst; secondly, the QFT checks for parallels by counting the amount of catalysts it has in its input buses for the recipe in question (with a maximum of 64 parallels, for a stack of the correct catalyst). This system makes it so that crafting 1 of the correct type of catalyst is required to unlock a recipe, but making more is completely optional and only changes the speed at which the multi crafts, provided it gets enough EU input.

Every catalyst needs some of the materials that it unlocks in the QFT, which is to say, the original processing line will have to be used to craft the catalyst that allows the player to skip it in the QFT. This applies to every recipe, and in turn every line that can be skipped.

To improve the general speed of processing, your one options is to get more parallels with catalysts. The other, more complicated way is to boost the chances of a successful output by adding more energy to the system, but in a special way: instead of using direct EU, using it to create a powerful plasma works to improve the QFT processing.

If the correct plasmas are added, the boosting will work, but it is also possible to upgrade the structure itself to perform chemistry skips that are not possible with the base QFT. These upgrades rely on more advanced and powerful materials, mainly in the material progression of DTPF recipes. However, those existing materials are not enough, because the quantum stabilization can’t be maintained with those “foreign” substances. Luckily, the QFT itself can produce the items needed to build the upgraded casings, and these items are outputs of some of the skips performed in the multi. It begins by allowing the much simpler production of already-owned materials but, in this process, it unlocks entirely new materials that are useful to improve the structure itself.

There are three new items and four tiers in the structure. The first tier can be built without them, but every new tier needs a new item crafted in the tier before. These outputs are related to the recipe where they can be obtained, and they possess unique characteristics that, in real life, are only theoretical.

The first item you will need to craft is the Hyper-Stable Self-Healing Adhesive. To craft this material, proceed with the Glue/Solder recipe by using the Adhesion Promoter Catalyst. Additionally, make these other catalysts to prove you're well set in your QFT journey.

Cleanroom-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADrA==.json,940,§6§lCleanroom,"If you want to make more advanced (and cheaper!) circuits, you will need a Cleanroom. The Cleanroom is an interesting multiblock, because you will be placing other machines §oinside§r of the room!

The cleanroom is a hollow multiblock between 3x4x3 and 15x15x15 (WxHxL) blocks. The base does not need to be a square; a rectangular shape is fine. The top layer is built out of Filter Machine Casings, except for the edges, which are Plascrete Blocks. The controller needs to be in the center of the top layer. If the width or length of the room are even, then it can be any one of the two (or four) middle blocks. The rest of the structure is built out of Plascrete Blocks.

Up to 30% of those Plascrete Blocks can be replaced by other valid blocks or materials:

A Reinforced Door lets you get in and out of the cleanroom. Make sure to keep the doors closed, or the cleanroom will rapidly lose efficiency. Travel Anchors and Elevators also work, you can even embed them in the floor if you want to.

In order to automate power and item transport through the walls, you can use Cable Diodes or Machine Hulls. Just be really careful when upgrading your machines to a higher voltage. Be sure to remove the machine hulls and diodes and replace them with the new power tier, or else you will be very sad. You don't need to do this for ones you only use to pass items through.

If you want to see inside, you can use any EV+ tier glass (for example, Reinforced Glass or Managlass). If the Cleanroom does not form, mind the 30% limit: often the problem is that you added too much glass.

Finally, the Cleanroom itself will need a Maintenance and Energy Hatch to run. The power usage of this multiblock is a bit unusual. It starts out at 40 EU/t and then gradually goes down. But even when it uses 40 EU/t - which is usually MV - a single LV energy hatch suffices, as long as you give it enough power. Just keep in mind that this makes the Cleanroom an exception, not the rule.

Let's build a 5x5x5 room for now. You can expand it later as needed. Give it power and let it run until it reaches 100% efficiency. Below 100% efficiency, machines inside the cleanroom have a chance to void outputs, so you want to keep the cleanroom running at all times!

Any maintenance issue reduces the maximum efficiency by 10%. Monitor your cleanroom with a Hand Scanner, Industrial Information Panel, or using a Needs Maintenance Cover and a Redstone Powered Light or Howler Alarm.


[note]Multiblocks such as the Large Chemical Reactor or Hyper-Intensity Laser Engraver don't need to be in a cleanroom. However, you will still need the cleanroom later on for other machines, like Bio Labs.[/note]

FocusingSciencea-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM2A==.json,3288,Focusing Science and Mystery,"This mechanic is completely optional, and never required for crafting. However, it’s greatly incentivized when the number of parallels is high and when crafting the unique items that unlock higher tiers. “Focusing”, in general, means to increase the chances of the outputs in a QFT recipe, and it can be done in two ways, possibly both at the same time. Each method uses a new plasma, both of which are crafted in a T4 Fusion Reactor by using other plasmas as the inputs, including one T3 plasma for each. These plasmas are Neptunium and Fermium and they can be used together, or individually.

When Neptunium Plasma is present, the current recipe can have one of the outputs focused. The specific output is chosen with a circuit in the input bus (this is the only thing circuits do for this multi), where circuit 1 is for the 1st output visible in NEI, circuit 2 is for the 2nd output, and so on. It is up to the player to choose which output they want the most out of all the existing ones, and the fact that every recipe has multiple outputs is because of this mechanic.

When an output is successfully focused with Neptunium, its chance increases by reducing the chance of all the other outputs. The logic for this change is as follows:

-> Without focusing, the chance of each output is 100 / number of outputs;
-> If the casing tier matches the recipe tier, the chance of all other outputs is halved and the sum of those halves is added to the focused output (for example, 20/20/20/20/20 becomes 60/10/10/10/10);
-> If the casing tier is +1 over the recipe tier, halve the other outputs' chance again (for example, 60/10/10/10/10 becomes 80/5/5/5/5);
-> If the casing tier is +2 or +3 over the recipe tier, set the focused output to 100% and the rest to 0%.

In general, this type of focusing doesn’t increase the total amount of outputs, save for the new items added with this multi that will come out in smaller quantities. Instead, it allows the player to replace less useful outputs with the more useful ones, and this choice is completely up to them, as is the choice of focusing at all.

When Fermium Plasma is present, the current recipe will have all of its output chances boosted, unless the chance for one of them is 100%, in which case that chance is unchanged. This happens because the boost increases if the output chance before ferm focusing is smaller, and the maximum boost is achieved when the chance is 0%, which happens with high-tier nep focusing.

When an output is successfully focused with Fermium, its chance increases based on how far it is from 100% chance. This applies to all the outputs at once, and the logic for this change is as follows:

-> If the casing tier matches the recipe tier, each output gets increased by 1/4 of the ""failure"" chance (for example, a 50% chance output has a 50% chance of failure, so it gets boosted by 12.5%, becoming 62.5%)
-> If the casing tier is +1 over the recipe tier, each output gets increased by 1/3 of the ""failure"" chance
-> If the casing tier is +2 or +3 over the recipe tier, each output gets increased by 1/2 of the ""failure"" chance

With the two plasmas combined and a +2 or +3 over recipe tier, a 5-output recipe would normally have 20/20/20/20/20 chances, but it becomes 100/50/50/50/50.

Many lategame multis have parallels, which means they complete the recipe several times at once every time the recipe time is completed, instead of only one, but they require extra EU to achieve this. This makes power the biggest constraint for those multiblocks, and the same happens with the QFT, given that recipe inputs are generally very cheap and simple. Throwing more power at the machine means more outputs, in general.

Given that, a player that wants a faster QFT will make more catalysts to unlock more parallels, but each added parallels adds to the other ones, to a cap of 64. Focusing, instead, changes output odds, which effectively multiplies the number of outputs per cycle. In terms of speed, a recipe with 4 outputs and 64 parallels runs at the speed of 256 parallels for the focused output if it’s nep focused to the maximum of 100%, since it was 25% originally. 

This is a lot of saved EU for high-tier, high-parallel QFTs, so it is the main reason for focusing, and both plasmas are useful here. However, plasma consumption is not the same regardless of parallels, it instead scales with the square root of the number of correct catalysts for the recipe, which is to say, the number of parallels.

This further applies to the 3 new items that are needed to upgrade the casing tiers. Since their output amount is much smaller than usual, they could get a further boost if focusing is being used, to incentivize the plasma mechanic when upgrading the multi.",法杖核心:魔力碎片,[3287],聚焦的科学与奥秘,"这一机制是可选的,而且无需更多合成.不过,当并行数很高,或者需要制作新物品来解锁更高等级时,它十分有用.“聚焦”---也就是说,提高量子操纵者的产物输出概率,有两种可选方式,也可以同时使用.每种聚焦方式都需要一种新的等离子体,镎和镄;它们需要在T4聚变中由其他等离子体(其中各包含一种T3等离子体)制作.两种等离子可以同时使用.当供应镎等离子体时,当前配方中可以选择一种产物作为聚焦产物;这一产物需要在输入总线中使用编程电路指定(这也是编程电路对该多方块的唯一作用),编程电路1代表NEI中的第1种产物,电路2代表NEI中的第2种,以此类推.玩家可以选择他们最需要所有产物中的哪一种;正因这一机制的存在,所有的配方都有多种不同的输出.当一种产物由镎等离子体聚焦时,该产物的产出概率上升,同时其余所有产物的产出概率下降.其改变机制如下：->一般情况下,当没有聚焦时,每种产物的概率均为100/产物种类数;->若结构等级与配方等级一致,其余所有产物的概率将减半,减少部分的概率转移到聚焦产物概率上(例如,20/20/20/20/20变为60/10/10/10/10);->若结构等级比配方等级高1,其余产物概率将再次减半(例如,20/20/20/20/20变为80/5/5/5/5);->若结构等级比配方等级高2或3,聚焦产物概率变为100而其余所有产物概率变为0.这种聚焦方式并不能增加总产量或是节省那些稀有的、随该多方块一起添加的物品;不过,通过选择聚焦产物,它允许玩家自己选择、并用更有用的产物替代不那么有用的产物.当提供镄等离子体时,当前配方的所有产出概率将全部增加,除非概率已经是100.镄等离子提供的增幅随着增幅前的概率减少而增加,在产出概率为0(高等级结构并实施镎等离子聚焦)时达到最大.当一种产物由镄等离子增幅时,其概率的变化由它与100的距离决定;这一增幅同时应用于所有产物,其机制如下：->若结构等级与配方等级一致,每种产物概率增加其“失败”概率的1/4(例如,一种50概率产出的产物有50概率失败,因而它会获得12.5增幅,变为62.5).->若结构等级比配方等级高1,每种产物概率增加其“失败”概率的1/3.->若结构等级比配方等级高2或3,每种产物概率增加其“失败”概率的1/2如果同时提供两种等离子体,并使用比配方等级高2或3级的结构,一个5种产物的配方的产出概率将从20/20/20/20/20变为100/50/50/50/50.许多后期多方块机器都有并行,即它们能同时处理多次同一配方,但也需要更多的EU;这使得功率成为这些多方块结构的最大限制,而对量子操纵者来说也是一样,特别是它的配方输入都相当简单便宜:功率越高,产量越多.也就是说,想要量子操纵者运行更快的玩家会做更多的催化剂来解锁更高的并行,但这种方式最多只能达到64并行.而聚焦能改变产物的产出概率,从而显著增加每次运行的产物数量.按产出速率计算,如果能达到100产出概率,64并行的4产物配方对聚焦产物能达到256并行的速率.对高等级、高并行的量子操纵者而言,这将节省大量的EU;这将是聚焦的主要使用原因,两种方式在这里都很有用.不过,等离子体的使用量并非与并行数无关,而是与配方催化剂数，也即并行数的平方根成正比。聚焦对3种用于升级结构等级的物品格外有用：因为产出概率比一般情况小得多,聚焦时它们能获得更多的加成,以激励玩家在升级多方块时更多地使用聚焦机制."

Toggles editing quests. Pressing RMB on the quest will open a context menu to share it or copy its ID.

/bq_admin reset all <Player>
Resets all quests. Use this if you want to start over, or are editing the QB. You should specify the player as well if it is a server, otherwise you can skip that part.

/bq_admin reset <ID> <Player>
Resets a specific quest, defined by the quest ID. Sometimes it may be easier to go into Edit Mode > Designer Tool to specify what to reset.

/bq_admin complete <number> <Player>
Completes a specific quest, similarly to the above. You can still claim the rewards. Use this command if a quest is broken, and then report it on GitHub, but please check if it's already reported.

/bq_admin default save
Saves changes to the QB after editing it.

/bq_copyquests <PlayerWithQuestsCompleted> <NewPlayer>
If you want to sync the quests with someone in your party, then use this. They won't get any rewards for that though.

/bq_admin hardcore
Enables BQ3 Hardcore Mode. You only start with 3 lives, so best of luck. Additional life hearts are available in the Kill all the Things tab.

Aside from the consume-type quests, a quest counts for everyone in the party if one person finished it. However, if someone joined your party later, you need to get them up to speed first either through /bq_copyquests above, or manually.

-Requires EV Circuits, Tungstensteel, Rocket Tier III
-Also requires Infusion, Void Metal (sufficient warp), Energized Node for CV, lots of Essentia
-16 block radius
-Can only change to a few specific Vanilla or Thaumcraft biomes
-Kind of slow

Use Ritual of Gaia's Transformation from Blood Magic
-Requires Void Metal, Infusion, Tungstensteel
-Requires getting deep into BM (and the warp that come with it)
-Requires 1,000,000 LP, Master Blood Orb, Tier 4 Altar and Awakened Activation Crystal
-10 block radius, can be exactly specified with bloodstone bricks (either type)
-Cannot specify which biome you get, you can only change the temperature/humidity within the 0.0 - 2.0 range and hope
-Some biomes may be impossible due to limited range and overlap
-Adjust temperature/humidity with items on 8 plinths around the Master Ritual Stone
-Need to relog to see changes
-Very little documentation or explanation
-Fast

Use the Brew of Shifting Seasons from Witchery
-Small range, depends on the level of the brew (power, not dispersal extent)
-Biome can be exactly specified
-Crafted using the complicated custom brew system
-Can add different ingredients to change range of the brew
-At min changes a single block
-At max has about a 3 block (circular) radius
-Instant (once you use it)

Use the Rite of Shifting Seasons from Witchery

ChemicalPseudoAl-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM1w==.json,3287,Chemical Pseudo-Altercations,"Learning more about the world and its ways is a sign of wisdom. However, the truly wise are the ones who know what is unimportant and can be skipped. For a true breacher of technology, the constraints of physics and chemistry are not essential. To skip past their technicalities, the Quantum Force Transformer comes into play.

This multi is meant to replicate the most popular and important processing lines in the pack’s progression, mostly those related to chemistry. Because of recursion in recipes, where earlier tier materials are required to craft higher tier equivalents, there are a lot of early processing lines that stay up through progression. Even worse, they often need more and more machines to keep up with increasing speed demands. To save on lag, this multi will do those processing lines in one step and without most of the extra chemicals that are added to purify the inputs into the outputs.

The Quantum Force Transformer (QFT) is unlocked in UEV, after Optical Mainframes have been crafted, and with the addition of a single Eternal Singularity and other materials. It’s a tall, 15x15 multiblock with many different casings, including two that are upgradable and decide the two tiers of the multi. Although it’s available in UEV, the upgraded casings require more and more expensive materials, while also unlocking skips for more advanced processing lines. For example, a platline skip can be done in the earlier QFT tier, whereas a Kevlar skip can only be done in the last tier.

Each recipe that the QFT has represents a single processing line or a big part of a line. The inputs for the early plastic skip, for example, are the basic components of the plastics on a molecular level (Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc.), and not the multi-step chemicals that were used half a dozen tiers earlier. All recipes have 3 or more outputs, and every output has a chance to appear: the chance for each is 100% divided by the number of outputs. To increase it, there are additional mechanics that can be used.

Simply put, the QFT uses huge amounts of energy and quantum field stabilization to disassemble simple molecules and assemble them into more complex ones, without needing additives or constrained processes. The only addition to the base inputs that the multi requires is a specific catalyst, which the smart circuits use to guide the materials into what they ultimately transform into, but they are never consumed or lost in any way. 

This direct process simplifies long processing chains to one step, but it has two consequences: it makes the process expensive, given the extreme conditions needed to undergo the transformation (in a similar way to fusion), but it also generates many different outputs at once, none of which are guaranteed, and it’s impossible to choose between them without adding something else into the setup to alter the conditions inside the QFT in some way. Throwing more energy into the multi won’t do anything, and better materials don’t seem to work, so what is the next step? That is what the next two quests will answer.

1) Find a correct crafting recipe with a screwdriver in NEI and use that.

2) Right-click while holding the programmed circuit to open an easy menu. You still need to at least have the screwdriver in your inventory though or it won't work. Eventually you can also make an electric screwdriver.

With IC2 crops you start with 4 slots and that multiplies by 4 every tier past §dLuV§r, every slot can take only 1 crop.

§lSetup mode (output):
§rThis mode allows you to move your Greenhouse or upgrade your crops.
When the machine is running in this mode it will output all planted crops in the output bus.

§lNormal operation:
§rWith normal crops it is a straightforward process. Base processing time is 5 seconds, at the end of operation all crops are grown and the outputs are added to the output bus. Additionally the time is lower every tier past §5EV§r §o(The time is divided by the number of tiers past §6HV§r§o, minimum 1 second. WOW)§r

IC2 crops on the other hand, are not that easy. They are normally simulated, but accelerated 32 times. Process time is 5 seconds. You can check the progress of the growing process with a tricorder.

If you want to grow your crops even faster, then you can use a fertilizer (up to §l400% more drops§r !). Machine will take fertilizer from the input busses on start of the operation and will be applied to that operation only. Each fertilizer gives +200% per crop in normal mode or +10% in IC2 mode. The bonus is applied evenly on crops. Examples:
Normal mode, 3 wheat seeds, 1 tea seeds, you insert 1 fertilizer, you will get +150% wheat drops and +50% tea drops.
IC2 mode, 16 melon seed bags, you insert 64 fertilizer, you will get +40% drops.

Additionally, all your crops need water to grow. Every single crop drinks 1000L per operation. So for example if you have planted 576 tea seeds at [note]UV[/note] voltage you will need 576000 L per second.

§lLast notes:
§rThe animation can’t be disabled.
The lamps can be inverted.
The dirt must be tilled.

",极限工业温室,[213],作物加速,"欢迎来到我的TED演讲,今天我们来谈谈极限工业温室.这是最先进且无延迟的作物农场,并可以为你提供成吨的作物.这台机器在EV阶段就可以制造,但想要解锁IC2杂交作物模式,还得至少为其提供LuV能量才行.放置控制器方块后对其使用投影仪即可显示整体结构.玻璃等级会限制能源等级,而UV玻璃支持所有能源等级.手持螺丝刀Shift+右键以切换作物模式(IC2/普通),很遗憾,你不能在同一台机器内同时种植这两种作物.这台机器管理作物有三种模式(使用螺丝刀切换):设置模式(输入):这个模式下,你可以将作物种植到机器中.只需将种子送入机器的输入总线,然后使用软锤启动机器即可.另外,你还需要输入IC2杂交作物生长所需要的方块(如果有的话)等到输入总线空了,就可以关闭机器并切换模式了.请注意,基于不同电压等级,机器内部的作物槽位是有限的.普通作物的初始槽位数为1,同时EV后的每个等级槽位数x2,每个槽位可以种植64株同种作物.而在IC2杂交作物模式下,初始槽位数为4,同时LuV后的每个等级槽位数x4,每个槽位只能种植1株作物.设置模式(输出):此模式下,你可以移动你的温室,或是升级作物.机器在此模式下运行时,将在输出总线中输出其内部的所有已种植作物.普通作物运行:对于普通作物,单次运行相当直截了当.基础运行时间为5秒,运行结束时所有作物都会长成,并将收获从输出总线中输出. 另外,从EV之后,运行时间不断缩短(基础运行时间除以超过HV的级数为实际运行时间,最小1秒.WOW) IC2杂交作物就是另一种运行方式,没这么简单了. 通常它们是模拟的,只是加速了32倍.基础运行时间同样是5秒.你可以使用三录仪来检查作物生长进度.如果你想让作物长得更快点,可以使用肥料(至多400％,多余会掉落!).温室会在运行开始的时候,从输入总线中提取肥料,并在本次运行中使用. 每株普通作物模式下的作物,施肥可以获得+200％,而在IC2杂交作物模式下则为+10％.此项增益均匀地应用于每株作物上. 比如：普通作物模式,3个小麦种子,1个茶种子,输入一份肥料,你可以获得+150％小麦掉落,以及+50％茶掉落.IC2杂交作物模式,16个西瓜种子袋,输入64份肥料,你会获得+40％掉落.另外,你的作物都需要水才能生长.每次运行每株作物消耗1000L水.所以,举例来说,如果你种植了576株茶作物,UV等级的温室,每秒需要576000L水.最后的注意事项:无法禁用动画.可以用反相灯.泥土必须为耕过的沃土(RandomThings-mod的).如果你遇到任何问题或有任何建议,请到github发issue并@kuba6000.这台多方块机器是我为了种茶写的..."

You can now use a wrench to connect only the pipes you want. You don't need a plate or a foil to prevent pipes from connecting anymore. The pipes will still autoconnect if you build one onto the other.

Pipes transferring anything hotter than a certain amount, like steam, will cause damage to a player touching them. You might want to cover hot pipes to prevent getting hurt. Also, if the heat level is higher than the pipe's heat capacity, it will melt.

Pressing RMB on a pipe in the center of the 'grid' will enable or disable a connection. It will have an X through it if the connection is enabled. You can do the same to any of the 4 corners to adjust the opposite side. You can similarly connect each of the 4 sides by clicking on the closest box in the grid.

Pipes have a free built-in shutter to reduce sloshing. Shift-RMB with a wrench on the side you want prevent input.

Pipes attempt to transfer half of their capacity twice per second, so the full capacity per second in total.

HelloBaronHowsYo-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACIg==.json,546,"§5§lHello Baron, How's Your Black Gold Today?","During your travels you may have seen some huge oil spouts. Now's the time to make a pump and go collect this black gold into tanks. Oil can be burned directly in a combustion generator (onsite to power the pump, perhaps?) or be refined for better fuels and crafting materials. 

Bring a generator or battery buffer (with full batteries obviously) with you to power the pump. Thanks to the advancement of technology the pump can auto output on top. Stacking multiple pumps makes them work faster. In that case, oil has to be removed from the bottom of the stack using a pump cover or other means like a conduit.

Taller spouts have more oil. But for the LV pump, it's better to use the short spouts if possible since it doesn't have enough range to fully collect the larger ones in the horizontal range. Save the taller spouts for MV or HV pumps.

Mining pipes are needed for pumping the oil, same as the auto miner. When it hits the bottom (or something in the way), if there's no fluid left to collect, it will start retracting the pipes. Same thing if you disable it with a soft mallet. You can also change the range with a screwdriver if there's a reason to do that, like collecting lava in a limited area faster.

These are GT machines, so remember to protect them (and their power sources!) from rain on all sides. And set a waypoint with JourneyMaps so you don't forget where you placed it!

HighTemperatureS-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMbg==.json,3182,§6§6§6§lHigh Temperature Super Breeder,"Have you heard of pebble reactors?

It's called the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR), and it uses fuel pebbles and consumes power. However, it doesn't really make a lot of power, and doesn't even match the EU/t of THTR, despite being much more expensive. The multiblock structure is basically the same, a huge reactor around 12x12x12 blocks in size, with 500+ casings made with Europium. What it doesn't make in power, it compensates in breeding, however.

For the unaware, this is expensive. Pebble reactors work by stuffing the reactor absolutely full of pebbles, and then the reaction will keep going for, essentially, forever. In this case, you will have a fully automated source of almost endless Lutetium, Plutonium and other things that will be explained in the following quests, alongside the production of fuel and the processing of outputs. What this means is that this is an expensive multiblock, but it's placed a tier in which this expense is actually reasonable, if there is a need for immense, endless breeding of many outputs.

If you're on the fence about building this, check the next quests to learn more about the fuel and outputs.

Notes:

HTGR has an internal buffer for fuel and only one input bus is required (any will do), as well as only one output bus (reactor automatically compresses every 64 burned pellets into one ball, so you need 6 slots or more to avoid problems with voiding at full capacity).

Reactor requires only 72k out of 720k pebbles to operate, but running at minimum capacity means that you will not get any bonuses, such as lower recipe time and higher amount of pebbles processed per cycle.

This multi consumes 1A LuV when operating, no matter how many pebbles are inside, but it also generates Hot Coolant as it runs. If you use it to generate power, you will gain more EU than is consumed by the reactor. 

In this reactor, the throughput increases with the amount of pebbles put into it.

KineticWindPower-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEcg==.json,1138,§9§lKinetic Wind Power HV,"The Kinetic Wind Generator generates energy from wind power which varies randomly, although certain factors can change this.

Unlike the Windmill, the Kinetic Wind Generator will require maintenance in the form of Rotors. These are needed to run the Kinetic Wind Generator.
Once a Rotor is placed inside the GUI, the block is given sufficient space, and the current wind level is adequate for the current rotor, the Kinetic Wind Generator will begin to generate Kinetic Energy. 

This can be converted into EU by using a Kinetic Generator attached to the correct face (the black circle).

About Wind
First off, the wind strength of a particular area is affected by 3 factors: Height, Weather, and Chance. The higher up in the world you are, the higher the wind level. Below y64, there is never enough wind to be used, and KWG's will not function at all. Weather will also give boosts; Rainy weather will give a 20% boost to normal wind levels, and stormy weather will give a 50% boost. The final factor of chance makes the wind strength vary randomly, however there is a limited range of variation.

The easiest way to check the current wind level in an area is by using a Windmeter. Wind is strongest at around Y160, towards the build limit of Y255 there is very little wind, hence no point attempting to run Windmills that high. While inconvenient, the Wind Generator can run anywhere.",风力动能发生机,[1137],风力动能发生机(HV),"风力动能发生机根据不同的风力,电力输出也会随之变化,虽然某些因素可以改变这一点.和风车不同,为了保证风力动能发生机的正常运转,你需要经常维护转子.一旦转子放置在GUI中,你需要确定风机的结构拥有足够的空间,并且当前位置的风力水平足够启动当前的转子.如果这些条件都满足,那么风机就会开始产生动能.将动能发电机贴到风机正确的面(黑色圆圈),动能发电机就会开始将动能转化成电能.关于风:首先,某一个地区的风力强度受到3个因素的影响:高度、天气和随机性.Y轴越高,风力就越强.如果Y轴低于64,那么你将没有足够的风能可以利用,风机也不会启动.天气也会不同程度的增强风力；雨天将会将会比正常提高20％的风力,雷雨天将会提高到50％.最后随机性将会使风力强度进行不规律的随机变化,但是这个随机变化将会限制在一个比较有限的范围内.检查一个位置的风力水平最简单的方式就是用风力计.Y轴在160的高度最强,而建造的最高限制Y=255风力则小的可怜. 因此将风机建设在特别高的区域是没有意义的.虽然安装起来不太方便,但风力发电机不要求生物群系."

The sieve may also help if you want to do it more exactly if you can make an alveary. You need either bees or butterflies, trees won't pollinate each other.

Trees have the following characteristics:
§eSaplings/Fertility§r: chance of getting a sapling from a destroyed leaf. Good for making into biomass or other uses. Balsa, Gooseberry and Sweetgum are what you want.

§bGirth§r: the width of your tree.  Wider trees have more leaves and logs, but will also need more saplings to begin growing. All saplings must be the same species and girth. The sapling in the NW corner determines the stats of the new tree, and is where bone meal must be applied to mature the tree. The Giant Sequoia is best here too.

§7Effect§r: not used in trees, so it's None for any.

Below is more information on some other parameters:

§2Growth§r: Sipiri trees have Tropical instead of Light, can only be bred in a Biome with temperature 90%-190% and humidity 90%-200%, and can only grow in 120%-190% temp and 90%-200% humidity. All other trees just need light to grow.

[note]Territory/Soil[/note]: all trees have Average, whatever that means. Probably something related to the below that never really got used.

§eTolerates§r: if it can be planted on sand or not. Only Desert Acacia and Grandidier's Baobab have this. The trait is either Plains or Plains, Desert.

§5Supports§r: what kind of fruits it can theoretically have. Determined by Species. Only fruits from families listed under this trait can be produced by the tree, regardless of what appears under the tree's Fruits trait. There is a number of trees from the Extra Trees mod that support all 4 types, but none from Forestry itself.

§aFruit§r: determines what fruit or nut it produces. Each fruit/nut provides different advantages:
Plum and Cherry Plum only produces 100L Fruit Juice, but have a 60% chance of producing Mulch in the Fluid Extractor or Squeezer.
Papaya produces 600L Fruit Juice, but only has a 10% chance to produce Mulch.
Coconuts produce 300L Seed Oil, but only have a 25% chance to produce Mulch.

MoronsGuidetoBre-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIoQ==.json,2209,Moron's Guide to Breeding Better Bees,"First off, don't be scared by the massive amounts of bees you see here once you unlock the breeding trees. There's even more that aren't included and you'll need NEI to find!

Ha ha, just kidding - don't panic! The breeding lines unlock bit by bit showing you what you can go for next, mostly from the top to the bottom. The large icons represent particularly powerful bees. Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options, only one is shown on the Bee Breeding Tree.

Bees have two sets of traits, active and inactive. The active one affects the behaviour of the bee while the inactive one is only relevant for breeding. 

A trait can be [warn]Dominant[/warn] or §9Recessive§r. When getting newly bred princesses and drones, check both sets in case you got the desired traits. You can breed the ones with inactive traits to try and make them active in later crosses. A Field Kit or GT scanner cannot see passive traits, you need a Beealyzer for that. 

When breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon a master template bee - a bee that has little to no crossbreeding potential but has all the traits you want - short life, nocturnal, cave dwelling, rain tolerant, humidity tolerance, temperature tolerance, 4xfertility, and so on. Once you have that bee, breed a bunch of pure princesses with those traits as both active and inactive. These will be your breeding stock.

When you are trying to get new species, what you want is a drone - this way you can use your ""breeding stock"" princess with the drone to get new species without the annoying effects or limitations. Poorly crossed princesses can be returned to normal by crossing with breeding stock drones, or just thrown into storage if they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you keep the trait and species you want, and slowly merge the good traits from your breeding stock. You don't have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee House to swap around traits. Remember that no species mutations occur in a Bee House. Ignoble bees are good to swap traits because they're mostly disposable - they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles, increasing slightly more each generation after that, though genetic stability frames can let them live longer. 

Once you solidify your species, create a pool of drones. You can use those to convert pristine princesses to the new species. Pristine princesses will not die, but they can become Ignoble under certain circumstances like using tons of production frames. Rocky bees are a great source - all their princesses are always pristine, they have decent traits, and there's a bunch of them underground. If you have an ender quarry, you can collect them with that.

Once you get a new species, it will replace either all Active or Inactive traits. If the mutation happens twice at the same bee, it will replace both sets. For example, when you get a Cultivated bee, either the Active or Inactive column will have all the default Cultivated traits. Mix it a few times and you'll eventually get purebred versions. Just watch out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker for Cultivated. Most effects are useless, so you can disregard them.

All quests require purebred species. Purebred means that the inactive species-trait is the same as the active one.

All traits can be bred into any bee species, aside from the species itself. Species also determines the preferred temperature and humidity, as well as drops. Species require their preferred temperature and humidity to be in the 'jubilant' state and produce their special drops. You can also mimic this with the alveary or industrial apiary, but NOT with tolerances.

Advanced frames can provide useful boosts to mutation chances or lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However, the excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay, giving a chance for a pristine princess to become ignoble.

But it's also a lot of dangerous and useful fun!",书,[500],"蜜蜂培育""智者""手册","首先,不要被你在这里看到的这么多蜜蜂吓到.还有更多没有写入这里的蜜蜂,你需要用NEI来寻找它们!哈哈,开个玩笑,不要慌!当你解锁了蜜蜂培育线之后,四处看看,然后选择真正使你感兴趣的完成.培育线从开始到结束大多数都是从左到右,从上到下的.某些底部的培育线可能看起来很简单,但它们所需的蜜蜂可能是别的线中的高级货色.许多基础蜜蜂有多种培育选择,这里只写一种.蜜蜂有两套特性,一套是活跃的(显性基因),对蜜蜂的活动方式有影响;另一套是不活跃的(隐性基因),但会影响遗传. 某些特性是显性的,而某些是隐性的. 尝试繁殖或培育新特性时请记住这一点. 当你培育出全新的公主蜂和雄峰后,检查两套特性,一致时你就得到了纯种的目标蜜蜂.你可以培育具有不活跃特性的蜜蜂,让它们通过之后的杂交中活跃起来.使用实地考察工具包时无法看到蜜蜂的隐性基因,你需要蜜蜂分析仪.对于大多数蜜蜂,你可以用GT扫描仪初步扫描它们,但你还是要用蜜蜂分析仪才能看到隐性基因.培育蜜蜂时,建立一个主模板蜜蜂是个好主意.所谓主模板蜜蜂就是一种几乎没有杂交潜力的蜜蜂,但拥有你所有希望的特性-短寿、夜行性、穴居性、耐雨飞行性、湿度与温度耐受力高、生育能力高等等.一旦你培育出这种蜜蜂后,繁殖一批显性/隐性基因一致的纯种公主蜂和雄峰.它们将成为你的培育储备.当你准备培育新品种的蜜蜂时,你需要的是雄峰-这样你就可以动用你的""培育储备""公主蜂,让培育更容易,记得新的雄峰也要纯化基因并去掉烦人的效果或限制.属性不好的公主蜂可以与你的""培育储备""雄峰杂交,重新加入你的培育储备,或者你也可以直接将其束之高阁(要是懒得洗掉那些烦人的效果或限制的话).确保新蜜蜂保持你需要的特性和品种,然后慢慢用你培育储备中的特性覆盖其余.优化基因的过程不必在蜂箱中进行,你可以使用蜂房来完成.请记住,蜂房中不会发生任何物种突变.卑贱种的蜜蜂很适合这项工作,因为它们可随意处理-在100个繁殖周期后,它们有几率死去,之后每多繁殖一代,它们的死亡几率就会稍微增加一点,不过遗传稳定升级之类的框架可以让它们活得更长久些.一旦你巩固了品种,留些雄峰.你可以用它们把始祖种公主蜂转化成新的品种.始祖种公主蜂不会死亡(不过在某些情况下(比如使用了大量提高产量的框架),她们会退化为卑贱种). 石头蜂就是始祖种极好的来源-它们所有的公主蜂都是始祖种,而且属性还不错,并且在地下到处都是.要是有个末影采石场,你可以轻易获取它们.一旦你获得了新品种,它会替换掉蜜蜂两套特性中的其中一套.如果你在同一蜜蜂碰上了二次突变,那么它的显性和隐性基因都会被替换. 比如,当你获得了一只田野蜂,每一条显性或隐性基因任选其一会被田野蜂的默认特性替换.经过几次混合纯化,你才能得到纯种的蜜蜂.当心别把关键特性弄丢了,比如田野蜂的快速工作特性!所有的任务都需要纯种蜜蜂.PS：大部分特性都用处不大,所以别太纠结.一般来说,所有的特性都可以培育进任意品种的蜜蜂,包括特殊效果或采蜜对象.蜜蜂的品种会决定其最佳温度/湿度环境,以及其产物.特殊品种的蜜蜂需要在其最佳温度/湿度环境下才会产出特殊产物.你可以通过工业蜂箱的各种升级来模拟类似的环境,但蜜蜂的耐受性无法让其在非最佳环境下产出特殊产物.先进的框架可以提供一些有用的帮助,如提高突变几率、或降低寿命以加快培育周期.但是过高的倍率会增加基因衰退几率,让始祖种公主蜂退化成卑贱种!看起来很复杂吧,因为本来就很复杂!但其中还是有很多危险与乐趣并存!WIKI：养蜂：gtnh.huijiwiki.com/p/424高阶养蜂思路分享：gtnh.huijiwiki.com/p/1166"

Setup
When setting up your EBF, make sure to place it a few chunks away from things pollution affects, like farmland. Pollution is nobody's friend!

During setup, make sure the center of the EBF is hollow. Sometimes things can sneak in there without you noticing, like a Thaumcraft light orb!

Make sure your muffler faces §lout§r, not §lin§r. The EBF can't work if it is not spreading those delightful odors!

When placing your power hatches, make sure to minimize the distance between any generators and the EBF. Especially at LV, those few blocks make a big difference! Every amp of energy traveling over a cable loses a little bit - and you'll need as much as you can get! Your best setup is to put two generators right next to each hatch, with a 2A cable. If you're poor, you could use 2 battery buffers with 2 batteries each directly attached to each hatch. Make sure to top off the buffers' generators. If you make 9 slot battery buffers, you can fill them up over time to get longer running time until you get stable power.

Output hatches and buses will automatically push into tanks and inventories placed next to them such as chests or BC tanks. They will also void if they're full, so keep an eye on them!

MoronsManualtoFe-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACzg==.json,718,Moron's Manual to Fecund Farms,"If you ever wanted to know how crop breeding works, you are in the right place! Get some Crops - the sticks, that is - and some seeds from farming with a hoe or mattock. You can also place some plants and berries directly on crop sticks. Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane. 

Make a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a row of dirt or cobble. You want to be able to see the center of each column of 3x1 plots all at once, like this:
FFFdddFFF
dddFFFddd
FFFdddFFF
dddFFFddd
FFFdWdFFF
dddFFFddd
FFFdddFFF
dddFFFddd 
FFFdddFFF
Now place crop sticks in each end of the 3x1 plot. Then place the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.

When they are almost fully grown you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks once more on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow new crops, even new species.

With some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can be scanned later.

Weeds need to be removed with a trowel or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.

Using 3x1 plots is easy and not much work.  Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one or two seeds. 

If you find a really nice seed, you can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle and others next to it for crossing. But this requires more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.

Note that the more crops next to the double crop stick the faster new plants will show up, up to 4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions of the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent like Agricraft.

Don't leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more crossing. 

Crossing happens when two or more almost-mature crops are next to a double cropstick. There is a high chance of getting the same species as the parents. The rest of the time will be a mutation.

This tab introduces you to a wide range of extremely powerful multiblock machines that can replace your old, worn-out singleblocks (and some that can replace your old multiblocks!). Many of these new machines will require you to handle additional mechanics and requirements, but it will be worth it!

Here are some terms you should be familiar with as you enter the world of multiblocks:

Overclock (OC): 
If a machine can handle at least 4 times the voltage that is required for a recipe, it will overclock - causing it to require 4x the EU/t but also run 2x as fast. This can happen multiple times!

Perfect Overclock (Often phrased as ""Does not lose efficiency when overclocked):
Some machines conditionally (or unconditionally) perform perfect overclocks: in this case, the machine will require 4x the EU/t, but it will run 4x as fast instead, leading to both increased speed and no net increase in the total eu usage!

Parallel (Often phrased as ""Processes x items""): 
Machines which parallel act as if they are running multiple of themselves - that is to say, they are able to perform multiple of the same recipe at the same time, using the recipe's EU/t multiplied by the number of parallels. Machines which parallel will [warn]PRIORITIZE[/warn] this behavior over overclocking, which is good for you! Parallels are more efficient.

SafetyFirst-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIcQ==.json,2161,§3§lSafety First,"For those new to GregTech, here are some tips and warnings about electricity. 

Machines don't like being out in the rain, and will start fires nearby. Fires next to a machine have a random chance of an explosion. Also, sending a higher voltage than a machine's tier causes an explosion. Or several, if you pack things together, like many people. Sending more amps than a machine can use doesn't harm anything though.

Sending too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of amps provided by generators and buffers to a cable does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.

A generator that supplies 1A can possibly feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than the full voltage.  For example, macerators processing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could run several from a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long. Why does that matter? Because there's loss for every amp for every block, listed on the wire/cable. Note that cables are better than wires. But be careful! Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect, like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.

Most machines only use 1A, however there are exceptions, such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge, world accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines can accept more amps than they use (usually 2) in order to top up their energy supply, especially if they didn't recieve most of the amp because of loss (mostly a problem in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage Tier + 1. Keep this in mind when deciding on cables.

Some machines are specifically there to help you deal with multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers, and diodes. Check out the quest tab Storing and Transforming EU for more on those.

If you want to send more amps, use a larger cable or a superconductor (MV+, but ULV and LV have their own lossless cables). You can use laser hatches much later to send even more. There even are wireless options, but not right now.

A single block machine starved of EU will restart progress but not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will lose the items.

Note that any block that emits EU has loss when doing so: 2 ^ (tier-1) per amp. So 1 EU at LV, 2 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers of battery buffers in a row is thus very wasteful of your power. You have to be careful with losses when making your first EBF later in LV, maybe rather power them directly? Of course, if you want to keep your amps topped up over longer distances, you'll need to place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps, though this is less the case the further ingame you get, as the loss becomes less of something to worry about.

If this info isn't enough for you, head on over to [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Electricity[/url] to read more.",警告标志,[70],安全第一,"对于那些GT新手,这里有些用电方面的提示和警告.机器不喜欢淋雨,否则附近就会着火.而机器附近的火有随机几率引爆机器.另外,给机器过高电压也会造成爆炸.在线缆里传输过高电压或过大电流会造成线缆被烧毁并在附近着火,而这可能造成机器爆炸.确保发电机和电池提供的电流数不超过线缆的传输能力.一台产生1A电流的发电机可能可以为多台机器供电-如果那些机器运行的配方低于满电压的话.举个例子,研磨机处理矿石时只需2EU/t,所以你可以用一台1A发电机带动好几台台研磨机,如果线缆不太长的话.(因为线损计算单位为/电流/米.请注意线缆会优于导线.)但是要当心!有时配方会需要超过你预想的高电压,比如研磨机沙子-->石英矿砂这个配方.大部分机器只会用到1A,但有些例外,如电弧炉、热力离心机、世界加速器、质量发生器.注意,为了确保运行时电力充足,机器可以接受比运行所需更高的电流(通常为2A),这在线损较高(通常是在LV阶段),机器接收到的1A电力包损失了太多时,尤其重要.机器接受最大电流的公式是:[(2*配方EU/t)/机器电压]+1.(""[]""表示向下取整) 选用线缆时请牢记这点.某些机器专用于处理多A电流,比如电池箱、变压器和线缆二级管.如果你需要输送大电流,可以使用更粗的线缆或超导导线(MV+,另外ULV和LV也有自己的无线损线缆).在后期,你还可以用激光仓输送巨量电流.跳电的单方块机器在有电后会重新开始处理,不会吞掉物品.但多方块机器跳电就会吞掉物品了.请注意,任何发送EU的方块都存在内阻,电压损失为2^电压等级. 比如LV损失2EU,MV损失4EU,以此类推.因此连续使用大量电池箱会对能量造成极大浪费,尤其在低电压阶段,甚至一个电池箱都会造成MV工业高炉无法稳定运行. 当然,如果你确实需要保持电流输送巅峰值,还是偶尔需要借助电池箱的,不过随着电压的升高,其内阻造成的损失影响也越来越小.如果这里还没有看明白的话,请转到 https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Electricity 阅读更多信息.

You can make it out of any GT material, but the best right now is NORMAL Draconium. [warn]Always test in Creative first![/warn]

When using turbines, be careful of flow rates. To find the optimal flow rate, you divide the optimal energy flow rate listed on the turbine, by the energy value for the plasma. You can also use the Large Turbine Calculator (there's a link on the main spreadsheet, which is linked to in discord), or scan the multiblock's controller while feeding it a minimal amount of plasma to see what the optimal flow is. Make sure to use a Fluid Regulator set to this flow rate for highest fuel efficiency, or go beyond it to get more EU/t at a cost to efficiency, with Plasma Turbines being the best at retaining efficiency beyond the optimal flow.

If you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 250% of optimal flow to produce 158% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 400% of optimal flow to produce 214% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 550% of optimal flow to produce 301% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away.

Large Ichorium 225% 1,360,800 EU/t (very durable)
Large Awakened Draconium 195% 491,400 EU/t
Large Trinium 185% 1,451,840 EU/t

At this point, you might consider building more t1 Fusion Reactors to process other materials. Even if you stop the reactor you're using to generate this plasma, the EU cost of restarting it is less than 1 bucket of plasma, so it's probably not that big of a deal.

The power output and final efficiency can vary a lot, based on which turbines you're using. Some of them, like Ichorium and Neutronium, last basically forever, while others will need to be replaced from time to time but offer higher efficiency. If you want to get more power per turbine, to reach closer to the dynamo's limit, you can increase the flow of plasma to the turbine, but be careful! You can't go beyond the dynamo's limit, and you will also lose efficiency as you increase the flow amount.

Vis in the state of Essentia is unstable if not stored properly. Left alone too long, or emptied out of the Crucible, Essentia will break down. But not into Vis. Rather, it will turn into Flux.

Flux manifests as a liquid or a gas, but is, itself, only a nuisance. Thaumaturges exposed to the stuff can end up getting Flux Flue, a condition which makes it harder to channel Vis, but it is only temporary.

Larger concentrations of Flux will solidify into Thaumic Slimes, bizarre creatures that try to merge with each other to grow larger. They can be dangerous, but are no less susceptible to crossbow bolts than most things.

However, if too much flux is allowed to linger for too long, it will corrupt the land and solidify into tendrils. This is a manifestation of the blight called Taint. Fibrous Tendrils (as well as condensed blocks thereof) spread the Tainted Lands, feeding on the magic it twists. Nodes are especially vulnerable, becoming Tainted themselves if exposed to this twisted magic.

Destroying the tendrils stops the spread, but unless §oall§r are destroyed this is only temporary. A more effective solution is to destroy the Tainted Land itself, as outside this specific biome tendrils quickly starve and die off.

To create a simple setup place the buffered tubes in a main line from your Arcane Alembic with tubes coming out of the main buffered tube line. These standard tubes will then go directly into a warded jar. To get the essentia to flow correctly into the buffered tubes, shift right click the output side of the buffered tube with your wand untill it is red. This will change the band to a red band which will limit the suction of the Essentia.

The Essentia will be forced from the buffered tube to a normal tube then into your Warded jars. Chain your buffered tubes as needed untill all your Warded Jars will fit.

First, you need to craft more advanced wands, the Greatwood Wand is next. And secondly, you need to improve your crafting discounts. They reduce the vis cost of crafts and thus also let you craft higher vis recipes.

In your progression you will need to rely on both aspects. Better wands and higher discounts. However, as you progress, there are many different ways on how to procede. Some ways focus more on discounts, others more on wands. Therefore, the questbook can only give you some general advice.

For example, when making a new wand type, it is always cheapest to first make it with iron caps and then try to improve it afterwards. However, if you are able to obtain enough discounts you can directly make the wand with gold caps or better, skipping the iron capped wand.

BasisforAllReact-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMSQ==.json,3145,Basis for All Reactors,"Nuclear energy is first available in EV. However, it comes in all shapes and forms, and it can be hard to choose one kind of setup to use amongst all of those that are available. To start this questbook page, this first quest will be a summary of how nuclear power can be produced, and when it is available. Other quests down the line will have more details about each specific setup, but this is an overview of all of them.

TL;DR: Nuke < Fluid Nuke < Vacuum Nuke < LFTR = THTR = Naq Reactor < Fusion < Compact Fusion for power, per reactor. For breeding, Nuke < LFTR = Naq Reactor < HTGR in terms of breeding speed and outputs, with fusion being required to make some materials.

The first nuclear source you have access to is the Industrialcraft 2 Nuclear Reactor, usually called a nuke. It's a small singleblock that can have additional chambers attached to it to make a multiblock structure, and the amount of chambers decides the amount of space available for the nuke's components. Inside it, fuel rods with radioactive materials generate power, and every other item serves to control the temperature of the reactor and keep it from exploding. It generates EU directly, but it can be upgraded to a fluid nuke, which outputs hot coolant instead, for the Large Heat Exchanger, but with more efficiency. Lastly, there's also the vacuum nuke, which is very similar to regular nukes but it cools down by using Coolant Cells, which wear out and are only reusable by using Vacuum Freezers. Usual fuels for all of these are Thorium, in EV, and Uranium, in IV.

Between IV and LuV, there's another kind of reactor, the Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR). In this large multi, the Thorium and Uranium are mixed with very hot, molten salts (which need to be prepared in another multi), improving the power generation at the cost of additional processing. It's an expensive setup, but the depleted fuel can be recycled into many more byproducts than usual, especially at LuV, where you can get almost all the noble gases amongst other things, alongside huge amounts of power.

At those same tiers (albeit mostly for LuV and above), there are also two larger multis, the Thorium High Temperature Reactor (THTR) and the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR). The THTR is mostly for power, needing an input of about 0.5 IV amps and outputting LuV power at a varied amount of amps, whereas the HTGR is a breeder reactor, outputting 1/20 the amount of hot coolant, which is where the power generation comes from, but with much better ratios for breeding into Lutetium and other elements.

Another kind of nuclear reactor is the Good Generators Naquadah Reactor, which coincidentally has recipes to consume Thorium Liquid Fuel and Uranium Liquid Fuel, alongside the several types of Naquadah fuel that exist. With these two, this reactor can process those elements much faster than regular nukes, which is helpful for power and for breeding, but it requires more processing until those fuels are ready to be consumed. Additionally, there are fuel rods for the IC2 nukes that use different Thorium and Uranium fuels, more or less related to these. 

From then on, it's fusion power. The infamous GregTech Fusion Reactors work by fusing two elements into a new one, which is often a required step for progression, but they also turn the power they require into exponentially more in the way of plasma. Helium and Tin Plasma are some of the most used for power, and putting them into Plasma Turbines is an excellent source of power for lategame, in ZPM to UEV and so on. There are 4 tiers to the regular Fusion Reactors, but there is also compact fusion and some other kinks to fusion that you might explore later on.

This page will mostly serve to guide you into making a choice between all of these possibilities. It's pretty much guaranteed that you'll use at least 2-3 of these setups, so try to get comfortable with these quest descriptions.",核反应堆,[176],所有反应堆的基础,"核能到EV阶段才能解锁.但是核电的设计实在是太多了,令人眼花缭乱,难以选择.作为本章节的第一个任务,这里将概述核电设计,以及它们何时解锁.此任务线之下的其他任务,将对每种反应堆进行详细介绍,本任务仅为概述.太长;不看：按照单反应堆功率排序核反应堆 < 流体反应堆 < 强冷反应堆 < 液态氟钍反应堆(LFTR) = 钍高温反应堆(THTR) = 硅岩反应堆 < 核聚变反应堆 < 压缩核聚变反应堆.对于增殖反应堆,按照增殖速度和产量排序核反应堆 < 液态氟钍反应堆 = 硅岩反应堆 < 高温气冷反应堆(HTGR),需要聚变反应堆制造某些材料.你能获取的第一种核电就是IC2的核反应堆,通常我们叫它核弹.它的本体是单方块机器,还可以加挂额外仓室组成多方块结构,仓室的数量决定了内部可用于核电部件的空间.在核反应堆内部,由放射性材料制成的燃料棒产生能量,其余部件用于控制堆温,防止爆炸. 核反应堆可以直接产生EU,但它还可以升级为流体核弹,不直接输出EU,而改为输出热冷却液,在通过大型热交换机、蒸汽涡轮转化为EU,这样比起核反应堆来说效率更高. 最后,就是强冷反应堆了,它与普通核反应堆非常相似,只是冷却部件换成了各种冷却单元,冷却单元损耗耐久吸收热量,只能用真空冷冻机修复耐久. 核反应堆的常用燃料有钍(EV阶段)以及铀(IV阶段).在IV和LuV阶段之间,还解锁了另一种反应堆：液态氟钍反应堆(LFTR).在这台巨大的多方块机器之中,钍和铀与炽热的熔盐混合(熔盐需要在另一台多方块机器中制备),可以说是以额外的处理流程为代价,提高了发电量.总之,液态氟钍反应堆是一台非常昂贵的发电机,不过其枯竭燃料可以回收,且获得的副产物比平常更多,尤其是在LuV阶段,你可以获得几乎所有的惰性气体,还可以得到相当可观的能量.同级别的(尽管主要是LuV及以上),还有两种更大的多方块机器,钍高温反应堆(THTR)和高温气冷反应堆(HTGR). 钍高温反应堆主要用于发电,需要大约0.5A-IV的输入,同时输出多A-LuV能量;而高温气冷反应堆是一种增殖反应堆,输出1/20的热冷却液,这也是其发电之源,不过关键是它转化镥及其他元素的效率很高.其他种类的核反应堆还有Good-Generators的硅岩反应堆,它除了拥有消耗多种硅岩燃料的配方以外,还凑巧有些消耗钍流体燃料和铀流体燃料的配方.对于钍和铀,这台硅岩反应堆相比普通核弹就快多了,这有助于提高发电量也提高了增殖效率,不过这些燃料需要经过复杂的处理才能最终使用.另外,IC2核弹使用的燃料棒,用的是不同的钍、铀燃料,或多或少与这些有关.再往后,就是核聚变能了.臭名昭著的GT牌核聚变反应堆,工作机制为将两种元素聚变为一种新元素,通常这种新元素是推进科技树的必需品,同时聚变产生的巨大能量则以等离子体的形式输出.氦离子和锡离子是最常用于发电的等离子体之二,将其送入等离子涡轮即为后期极好的能源,从ZPM到UEV等阶段都很合适.普通的核聚变反应堆有4个等级,另外还有压缩核聚变反应堆,你会在之后的进程中逐步探索这些.本任务章节主要是指导你在所有这些可能的选择中,挑出最适合自己的.我保证你一定会至少用到其中的两三种的,所以尽量仔细阅读任务描述吧."

These are the two main components of the previous solders, and that's the reason they're needed now. Tin Plasma is t2 fusion, and you might have already made a lot of it to generate power, but Bismuth Plasma is t3, with the inputs being Zinc Plasma and Molten Tantalum, which is actually Tritium, Copper and Tantalum in the end. 

The recipes are cheap in power, you just have to make sure the inputs are there.

CanWeGetUraniumH-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMYA==.json,3168,Can We Get Uranium Here?,"Yes, you can. In fact, you can get it much earlier than EV, but the speed at which you get it can vary wildly, depending on how you approach this problem. Uranium is the main upgrade to Thorium in nukes, with a lot more power to give and a different useful breeding byproduct, but you need about 3 stacks of Uranium 238 to set up the most powerful basic IC2 Uranium Nuke.

How do you get it, though? The one answer is, you get it from Thorium. Looking at NEI, the Thorium ore processing has a chance to give Uranium dusts, which you can use as fuel, but this happens very slowly, especially considering that Thorium is a rare ore in the Nether, even if each ore block gives 4 crushed dust. The reality seems to be that fast Uranium only happens when you can mine from t2 planets, but this is not the only way. There is a secret, and this secret involves IC2 crops.

How does it work? Well, it's simple. The IC2 crop that corresponds to Thorium, the God of Thunder, can quadruple each Crushed Thorium Ore into 4 Purified Thorium Ore, but it also outputs, in fluid form, one Uranium Ingot! This means that each Thorium Ore gives you 4 Uranium Ingots, and with around 42 ore, you can do one cycle of that big reactor setup. God of Thunder needs the ore under it, though, so make sure you save some for that purpose.

EV Uranium nukes are a achievement intended mostly for IC2 crop users, so this quest won't demand something like that. Still, it's a useful secret, so here it is. Additionally, the Uranium crop quest in the questbook awards you with 32 Pitchblende when you complete it, which might prove useful for both for quadrupling Uranium and getting Radium for Radon!",铀-238粉,[3157],我们能在这弄到铀吗?,"是的你可以.事实上,远不用等到EV阶段你就可以获得铀,不过速度会有很大差异,这取决于你如何解决这个问题. 在核弹上,铀是钍的主要升级,带来了更多的能量,以及一种不同而有用的增殖副产物,但你需要大约3组铀-238才能摆出最强的基础IC2铀核弹.不过怎么获得呢?其中一个解答就是,从钍中获取铀.请查看NEI,处理钍矿石的过程中,有几率获得铀粉,可将其用作核燃料;但是,考虑到钍是下界的稀有矿石,即便一个矿石可以出产4个粉碎矿,这样的获取速度还是太慢了. 看来想要快速获取铀,只能等到T2行星解锁后在其上直接开采铀矿了,不过这并非唯一方式. 有一个秘密,涉及到IC2杂交作物.应该怎么做呢?嗯,很简单.有一种IC2杂交作物叫做雷神之草(God-of-Thunder),对应的就是钍,其产物可以将每个粉碎的钍矿石翻两番,转化为4个纯净的钍矿石,而且还能同时以流体的形式输出一个铀锭!这意味着每个钍矿石可以给你4个铀锭,以及大约42个矿石,你可以完成一个大型反应堆设施循环. 需要在雷神之草下方放置对应矿石才能使其完全成熟,所以别忘了留点矿石.EV铀核弹是一项主要针对IC2杂交作物玩家的成就,所以本任务不要求这些东西.不过这仍然是一个有用的秘密,所以我在这里与大家分享.另外,在任务书中,铀作物任务的奖励是32个沥青铀,不管是用来四倍铀还是获取镭进而得到氡都是极好的!"
DuraniumandtheCy-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMgw==.json,3203,Duranium and the Cyclotron,"In the previous quest, Duranium was introduced as a material used to make Tritanium. While it becomes required for this reason, there is more to it than that. Another recipe that uses it is a Cyclotron recipe, which has a chance to produce a Quantum Anomaly. 

First off, what is the Cyclotron? That is a multiblock that works a bit like fusion, but only for the purpose of making new materials. It collides single particles with one another, or against fluids, to generate new items while consuming power. Most of the recipes it has won't be very useful, if at all, but it can also make Quantum Anomalies. This is a chance craft, but the Anomaly has a special property: when used to convert some blocks to others, it will not be consumed. Therefore, for that purpose, you only need to get one.

Is this required? Well, yes. When you arrive at a certain stage of the game, you might find yourself needing a new kind of soldering alloy, called Mutated Living Solder. To craft this, you need a Chemical Plant made with Botmium, which is an alloy that required Advanced Nitinol. This, in turn, is one of the blocks that need a Quantum Anomaly for its conversion. Given that Duranium is the only fluid choice to make the Anomaly, then it becomes required for this as well, but only a couple tiers from ZPM.

Additionally, there are other recipes, like the Elemental Duplicator. This is a very powerful replicator that will give you a great boost in automation due to its speed and the replication recipes it can do, but the Quantum Anomaly used in this recipe will be consumed, so watch out: if you only have one, don't use it for this.

All in all, the Tier 2 Rocket makes things a lot easier by letting you mine ores on Mars and Phobos to get Uranium and Tungstate/Scheelite. However, building it requires considerable progression in EV, due to TPV Coils, which need Titanium and Platinum, and the Mainframes that the rocket needs. In IV, fluid nukes are one of the best choices for efficient power without a lot of setup, although it's very viable to use Thorium and not just Uranium, so you can ignore Uranium Fuel Rods and use fluid nukes in EV if you so wish.

ExcitedFluidNuke-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMZQ==.json,3173,Excited Fluid Nukes,"This quest is after the vacuum nuke one because the fuel required to do a setup like this is harder to get. Whereas the previous rods were made with compressed Uranium, this fuel needs that same material to then be further processed in GoodGenerators machines, namely the Neutron Activator, to make Excited Uranium Liquid Fuel. It is directly usable in the Naquadah Reactor, with more fuel efficiency there, but you might not be able to build it yet, since it's post-fusion. Instead, you can use said fuel here.

Before attempting this, you need to know all the mechanics related to the fluid nuke. In fact, this quest won't even have any required tasks, given how challenging it is to create a good setup of this kind. At the time of writing this quest, there is no nuke simulator that supports the Excited Fuel Rods, which means you'll have to first test in Creative mode and gather whatever results you get from there.

The basis for this setup is simple: Excited Uranium Fuel Rods, the only kind you should consider for this, output 16x more heat than the regular ones, which is a lot more Hot Coolant output if you can send all this heat to the reactor to be turned into power. Only the heat matters, which means that extra EU/t based on temperature will do nothing here. Throw as many rods as you can at this nuke without overheating, that is the challenge.

What then? You will surely need many multis if you want to process LuV amps of power, unless you choose some more advanced options.

The fuels themselves are more complicated, but the three of them follow a similar set of recipes. First, you grab a lot of the radioactive element (Thorium, Uranium or Plutonium), wrap it in a specific foil and then put in an Implosion Compressor to make very dense nuggets. These are into the High Density items you need, which are then mixed with specific dusts to create the basic fuel fluid.

This part is where it becomes complicated, though. To get the energy out of this radioactive fluid, you need to activate it. Thorium is done by mixing with Helium Plasma (t1 fusion), while the other two are made directly in the Fusion Reactor (t2 fusion). The activated fuels can be thrown directly in the reactor to produce EU, at a very slow pace. Your bottleneck should be the main radioactive element, so make sure you can source it fast enough.

Being here, you should have a Large Naquadah Reactor ready to go. However, it is true that these Excited Fuels can be used to make fuel rods for IC2 nukes, with much larger heat outputs meant for fluid nukes. You can try to use them there, but there are no simulated setups of any kind for those rods, so it's going to be a very experimental setup if you ever decide to make it.",铀基流体燃料(激发态)单元,"[3196, 3180]",激发流体核弹2,"随着反应堆的落成,是时候实现燃料和添加剂(这里有一定的添加剂)的自动化了.它们是可选的,所以让我们从所需的输入开始吧.液态空气很容易实现自动化：这是真空冷冻机的工作.输入EU和空气,输出液态空气,有相关的任务. 而燃料就更复杂一些,但它们三种都遵循一套相似的配方.首先,拿上大量的放射性元素(钍、铀或钚),将其用特定的箔包裹起来,再送入聚爆压缩机中,制成非常致密的粒.这些就是你需要的高密度物品,然后与特定的粉混合,制成x基流体燃料.不过,这一部分开始变得复杂起来了.想要从这种放射性流体中获取能量,你需要将其激活(激发).钍基流体燃料的激发需要将其与氦等离子体(1级聚变)混合,而另外两种直接在核聚变反应堆中制得(2级聚变).激发后的燃料可以直接丢进反应堆中生产EU,不过速度非常缓慢. 你的瓶颈应该在于主要的放射性元素,所以请确保有充足的供应.在这里,你应该已经造好了一台大型硅岩反应堆.不过,这些激发态流体燃料还可以灌装成IC2核弹用的燃料棒,再配合流体核弹可以产出多得多的热量. 你可以尝试在那里使用这些燃料,不过没有支持这些燃料棒的模拟器可用,所以这会是一座实验性很强的发电设施,如果你已经决定了的话,祝你好运!"
FasterLutetiumEx-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMbA==.json,3180,Faster Lutetium Excitement,"This quest is late LuV.

You might have read before that Lutetium is necessary as an input for fusion crafting. In a tier 2 fusion reactor, Lutetium + Chrome = Americium, a required material for many required crafts. Lutetium is a material that is obtained exclusively from breeding, so you're in the right place to find ways to get it.

The very first method, EV's IC2 Thorium nukes, is the cheapest, but also the slowest. Each fuel rod takes 50000 seconds to deplete, almost 14 hours, with half of a Lutetium Dust per depleted rod. Highly stackable designs, such as the 2-chamber 11 quad rod one, will grant you 22 dust per cycle. After building 10 of those, the rate is still 16 dust per hour. This processing speed isn't good enough to keep progressing forever, and there is no need to make more towers of breeder nukes.

Your 5 main options are:

1) HTGR - fastest but also quite expensive multiblock reactor, unfortunately it requires purified thorium232 you will need to purify it first
2) Lutetium bees - if you started bees getting it should be quite easy

FirstHalfofLFTRB-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWA==.json,3160,First Half of LFTR Breeding,"The LFTR processing chain has two halves, with the first being in mid-late IV and the second requiring the Assembly Line and more materials to finish. Aside from power, both of these halves have special outputs that can be helpful for progression, but the second half is most likely the one that holds the most value. Regardless, the full processing chain around the reactor and its fuel will keep outputting everything, so it's worth it to look at what it gives.

Let's start with the LFTR Fuel 1 outputs, after the fuel is consumed in the reactor. U233 and UF6 are both used to make more fuel. U233 will be used until you have Sparge Towers to improve your fuel production, while UF6 is a part of the good fuel recipe that you always want to use. T Salt is processed in the Reactor Processing Unit to yield Proactinium, which decays into even more U233, and then in the Cold Trap to yield more U233 and UF6.

Remember: U233 is the early source of fuel, UF6 is the one you will switch to as you progress.

Meanwhile, U Salt also processes into more fuel, but with a bonus of automated Phosphorous Dust. Unfortunately, you won't get a lot of it, but it is still a breeding output from the nuclear fission and is needed for GT++ alloys and other purposes.

FirstStepsinRepr-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMag==.json,3178,First Steps in Reprocessing,"You now have 4 different fluid outputs running away from your LFTR. Each of them needs specific attention, and all of them are useful. 

Where to start looking? The best way to start is at the end, which is to say, the Fuel Refinery. You want to upgrade to the better fuels as soon as possible, and each one has 2 recipes: one with 4 inputs, similar to the recipe you've already done, and one with 2 inputs, focusing on LFTR Fuel Base. The 2-input recipes produce 10x the fuel, so they're much better, but you can't use this recipe alone. The Fuel Base can only be made from reprocessing depleted fuel, and you don't get enough of it to make the same amount of fuel spent. If you perfectly reprocess any of the first two fuels to get Fuel Base, you will come out short and run out of fuel.

Given that, your strategy will be to use two Fuel Refineries, one for each Fuel 2 recipe, and then change them to Fuel 3 once you've built the Assembly Line, which is required to build the final multiblocks in this line. For Fuel 2, get as much Fuel Base as you can from this chain - EBF <- DT <- RPU <- LFTR and put it into one of the refineries, while using the second one to top off on the remaining fuel you need to keep the LFTR going. You can limit the UF4 on the second refinery to not make too much fuel there, or just turn it on and off, and use as much of the better recipe as possible. You will be able to use the better recipe 100% of the time, but only after building a Sparge Tower.

FluidNukes-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUg==.json,3154,Fluid Nukes,"Eventually, the previous nukes will not be big enough. You can make more of them, to get more power, but it's clear that you need something bigger. Bigger, literally. The next step in nuclear fission starts with a bigger multiblock, built on top of the original nuke. By surrounding it with a 5x5x5 cube of Reactor Pressure Vessels, it will become a different type of multiblock, the fluid nuke.

After doing this, there's no direct EU generation anymore. The main output of a working fluid nuke is Hot Coolant, a fluid that can be turned into Steam or Superheated Steam in another multi, the Large Heat Exchanger (LHE). Steam means power, as you already know, so the obvious chain of processes here is a fluid nuke into an LHE, and then into Steam Turbines. These added steps are required to make EU from a nuke of this type (or, at least, they're the most popular way of doing it), but this work is rewarded by the final EU/t output of the setup, which is much larger than a regular nuke's output with the same amount of fuel.

The difference exists because regular nukes actually have a 50% penalty to EU/t. It's such a big step-up that, in reality, one fluid nuke is enough for IV power, if it's powerful enough. The one in this quest, though, is not that one, because fluid nukes in general have some additional complications that will be harder to deal with it. In fact, for this, you have the option to use Thorium as fuel and still get a good amount of power!

Thorium, Uranium, Thorium, Uranium... what about all of these other things, what do they do?

Unfortunately, this is where the copying of builds ends. The nuke research that has been done is almost all about the fuel rods that existed from base IC2, namely the Thorium, Uranium and MOX ones. Almost all the others were added with GTNH, and they are more or less ignored by most players. However, not all of them are useless! To see why, keep reading.

GoodGenerators has added two new pairs of Uranium and Plutonium rods: High Density, and Excited. Both of these use a lot more of the element per rod, to the extent where you'll need stacks and stacks of each to run a single nuke, which means that these are fuels for later in progression, when you have stockpiled a lot of U238. The main difference is that High Density rods output a lot more EU/t with the same heat output, whereas the Excited rods do output a lot more heat than usual. This means that the former are good for vacuum nukes, while the latter are good for fluid nukes. This is true because vac nukes want more EU/t from rods with less heat, to make the coolant cells last longer, while fluid nukes produce Hot Coolant directly from the amount of heat dissipated into the reactor. The Plutonium versions also have MOX-like behavior, while the Uranium ones don't.

This is not the end of high-powered nukes, though.

Europium is the first wall that can be solved by fusion, and only by fusion. It is possible to find it in ores, but even the most complicated magic rituals to get them need some Europium to start, which leaves fusion crafting as the most reliable option to automate the entire process. It is a slow craft, but not an expensive one provided you already have the reactor built, since it uses cheap materials as inputs: Hydrogen and Neodymium. Both of these were used extensively for progression, so you should not have any trouble grabbing several hundreds of each to start this reaction.

It is important that you gather a lot of inputs. Each time the Fusion Reactor changes recipe, it has a start-up period where it needs a large amount of energy to begin crafting. In the case of Europium, you'll need 150 million EU to start crafting it, and then 7,077,888 EU per ingot of Europium crafted. This does not come out as plasma, so you can't get energy back from it! Additionally, each ingot takes 14.4 seconds to craft, so you can come out with a few stacks of Europium relatively quickly.

If you ever though that a vacuum nuke doesn't burn through Uranium fast enough, this one is for you. High Density Uranium, or HDU, outputs twice the EU of the regular Uranium rods, and lasts for 70000 seconds instead of 20000. The heat output, like mentioned before, is the same, so the actual effect of using these rods in a vacuum nuke setup is that your final EU/t per nuke is multiplied by 2, and rods will need to be replaced less often, but the U238 consumption per cycle is a lot higher.

This also helps if you aren't automating the fuel rod input, since each one lasts longer. It's better if it's automated, but there's no danger of explosions if this part is done manually, so it's technically safe, as long as your EU buffer doesn't start complaining from lack of input.

HowMuchPowerFrom-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMWw==.json,3163,How Much Power From One Reactor?,"A completed Fusion Reactor does not generate any EU on its own, it only consumes it. That said, it's very simple to generate power from plasma, a one-step process of having a Plasma Turbine. These special turbines only work with plasma and are significantly more expensive than the previous ones, requiring Tungstensteel for the body and Naquadah + Naquadah Alloy for the controller.

First, how much plasma can one tier 1 reactor produce? The best option for power at this stage is Helium Plasma, with its cheap inputs, and this takes 6.4 seconds per bucket to generate. Since a bucket is worth 81,920,000 EU, that equates to 640,000 EU/t at 100% efficiency or 960,000 EU/t at 150%. That is almost 8 ZPM amps, a massive power spike compared to the powergen available before this, with almost no processing before the plasma! For most players, fusion is the only source of power for 3 or 4 tiers, and all other ways of getting power are much more complicated and harder to upscale.

That said, you will still need multiple turbines to actually consume all of the plasma. At LuV, each turbine can only output the equivalent of 1 ZPM amp, so you will need high-efficiency turbines that don't go above the value of 131,072 EU/t output.

What about everything else? The entire setup has 2 inputs and 4 outputs. One of the inputs is any of the 3 possible fuels, the other input is Lithium Tetrafluoroberyllate (LTFB). On the output side, there's one constant: U233 is output in small quantities at random, averaging 10 seconds per output.

LiquidFluorineTh-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMVw==.json,3159,Liquid Fluorine Thorium Reactor,"What a complicated name this is. What does it mean?

Well, it's what is called a molten salt reactor. The Liquid Fluoride part means that the nuclear fuel is actually a liquid, mixed in with fluoride salts. This is a mechanism that makes it more difficult to get the fuel ready for fission, but also makes the process more efficient, gives out more byproducts and also removes the danger of explosion. That's right, nuclear meltdowns are a thing of the past! The molten salt is designed to flow downwards into a hole where it solidifies, in case the reactor has problems, so it's impossible for the fission process to continue into an explosive mess.

There are three downsides, though. One of them was mentioned just above, the fuel needs more processing to be ready for the LFTR, and more input materials to reach the right mixture. After it goes through the reactor, it comes out as depleted, and this part too requires more processing steps, although it gives out a lot more useful chemicals than the single Lutetium/Plutonium the IC2 nuke depletion process gave. Lastly, the molten salt is very hot and very corrosive, which means it would destroy the materials used to build the IC2 nukes. You will need newer, stronger and more expensive materials to build a reactor, not to mention its much larger size. 

The structure for this multi is truly something else. It has not one, but four required Dynamo Hatches, which should all be the Buffered type, either EV, IV or LuV depending on the fuel being fed into the reactor, with better fuels being unlocked at later progression stages. This means that one LFTR makes either 1 LuV amp, 1 ZPM amp or 1 UV amp while running. It also requires 2 Maintenance and 4 Muffler Hatches, when it has no maintenance problems or pollution output! Mysterious are the workings of this reactor.

Other than this, all the inputs and outputs are fluids. The minimum amount you'll need is 2 inputs and 4 outputs, although one of the outputs comes out over time, and not on recipe finish.

It is a 6-chamber, like usual, and it takes U238 as before, but it outputs close to 6820 EU/t while only using 5 quad rods instead of 7. How is this possible? The answer is... MOX.

MOX means mixed-oxide, which is the name given to the mix of Uranium and Plutonium. In here, rods with this fuel are special in the sense that they don't output a specific amount of EU/t from the usual nuke mechanics. On top of those, it also reacts to the heat of the reactor, generating more energy the hotter it is. To compensate, these rods last only half the time that the Uranium fuel rods do, but their total EU is higher if they are active in very hot reactors. This imposes an obvious problem - hot reactors are not good for your base.

There is one standardized way of dealing with this: heat-neutral reactors. What this means is that the reactor's temperature does not change while it's active, because the components inside are not interacting with the reactor's temperature value, only with the value of other components like the fuel rods themselves. This limits the type of components you can use, and you'll find that Advanced Heat Vents are now required (the overclocked ones interact with the reactor itself). However, at the same time, you can use any fuel rod to heat the reactor up to a high temperature and then activate a setup of this kind, which ensures safety and efficiency in MOX nukes.

The answer to that question isn't even a nuclear fission generator, for the most part. The answer is the Large Naquadah Generator. It follows the same principle as the LFTR, use a new processing chain to turn Thorium, Uranium and Plutonium into liquid fuels, very dense with energy, which are then slowly burned to generate large amounts of power over a very long period of time. This reactor, for example, burns its fuels 1 milibucket at a time, over several seconds, when running without additives, a very slow burner by default.

Let's look at the NEI recipes. Excited Thorium outputs 2,200 EU/t, Excited Uranium outputs 12,960 EU/t and Excited Plutonium outputs 32,400 EU/t. These are small numbers, clearly, so this can't possibly be the most powerful nuclear fission reactor. However, this multi is more complicated than that!

The controller's tooltip lists all the possible additives and their bonuses.

NuclearFuelProce-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMaA==.json,3176,Nuclear Fuel Processing,"The previous reactor is useless on its own, unfortunately. Even if you have built it fully, there's no way to get fuel that it will accept without making another multi that mixes and processes several chemical mixtures into one, the molten salt that generates all that nuclear energy in the LFTR.

The multi's name is Reactor Fuel Processing Plant (RFPP), although it's easier to call it the Fuel Refinery. It's a mid-late IV multiblock, like the LFTR, especially due to needing 2 ZPM circuits for the Computer Cube used in the controller's recipe. The other casings are similar to what you've made before, and the tooltip gives a good description of what exactly is needed to build the Fuel Refinery. 

Where to put each casing? The bottom two layers are 3x3, and they take the Structural Blocks. On top of the second layer, in the middle block, make a tower of 5 Fluid Containment Blocks, and then cover these with Sealant Blocks, like you would do in a Multiblock Miner. However, the second layer of the 5, from the bottom, uses Reactor Shielding Blocks, 4 of them there instead of the Sealant Blocks. Use the Hologram Projector for assistance if you're having trouble.

When it's fully built, you can focus on the recipes. Out of the 5 that are available, you can only do one at this time, the Fuel 1 recipe. To make this fuel, you need molten U235, but also Lithium Fluoride, Beryllium Fluoride and Zirconium Tetrafluoride. Each of the these elements can be obtained with relative ease, each in their own way, but Fluorine is the main part of all this, the main component of the molten salt, so it's a good idea to have a decent source of it. However, the LFTR fuels are also very, very energy dense, so each bucket of Fluorine can bring you a long way.

If you're looking through NEI, your first response might be ""There are no recipes for these fluorides other than reprocessing the depleted fuels! How am I supposed to make these?"". The answer is in the dusts: you have to craft the dusts and then fluid extract them into the fluids. There is a spreadsheet which has all the steps in crafting and reprocessing ([url]https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_1JGSt5-ELdra6emngUc7XvKSJc-_-RO0yreRIbOrx0/edit?usp=sharing[/url]), to help with how complicated this chain is. 

Just make sure you remember, each bucket of fuel is worth many millions, perhaps even billions of EU! Don't let the 207M EU cost per bucket of Fuel 1 discourage you, it turns into much more energy in the LFTR.

After several hours in the reactor, the fuel is considered depleted and there's enough Plutonium in it to separate the two through thermal centrifuging, a basic and inefficient way to do nuclear reprocessing. Later on, it's possible to improve your methods of handling spent nuclear fuel, but this is the first way you get this nuclear byproduct.

That sort of setup is shown in this quest, but it requires more multiblocks, and therefore more expense than the previous quest's chain. The fuel is the same, Uranium, so at this point it's certainly the least of your worries, until you try to automate the fuel input, at least.

The components inside the nuke get more and more complicated, so at this point I'm going to ask you to look at the wiki, under the Nuclear Reactors page ([url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Nuclear_Reactors[/url]), and scroll down to the fluid nuke setups, specifically the 1352 HU, 2 Quad Uranium and 1408, 3 Quad Uranium, 1 Dual Uranium ones. The main difference between these two setups is that the first needs Iridium Neutron Reflectors, which are quite expensive if you haven't done the platline yet, while the second doesn't use them but is harder to automate due to having more than one type of rod.

After automating the nuke itself, there is still more to do, though. The LHE is required, as usual, but these setups cause something new to happen: the LHE starts outputting Superheated Steam, due to the high flow of hot coolant that it receives, which means that you need two sets of turbines instead of one. This type of steam must go into Large HP Steam Turbines, which use a good amount of Tungstensteel for the controller and stacks of Titanium for the casings. After those, it goes into the usual Large Steam Turbines, and the process is complete.

There is yet another new thing to worry about, in case all of this wasn't enough: the Steam flow is very high, higher than before, which means it's likely you will need 3 or more of each turbine type, further compounding on the costs you'll have here.

Compact Fusion. If you've been looking for a big multiblock to put together, you have arrived at a very neat thing. There's hardly anything that could beat its size, except for a max height Mega Distillation Tower, but this is instead a wide multi instead of a tall one. It is so wide, in fact, that it cannot fit in one chunk, and instead covers a 3x3 chunk space! Make sure you follow the instructions and the hologram properly, and jump in joy when you have one of these built.

You can choose one of four tiers for this reactor, in the same way as the normal Fusion Reactors. The Compact controller will need 48 of the regular controllers in the same tier, plus some other materials, and more than 2 thousand blocks in the structure, which are conveniently detailed in the tooltip. It is much bigger than the previous reactors, but it also has a huge number of parallels, starting at 64x with t1 and ending at a maximum of 320x with t5! 

This is the go-to when you have found yourself deep into t3 fusion, perhaps even t4, and you find yourself running short on power. Instead of making a tower of reactors, why not make one of these? The only power issue that you'll have after getting it done is the amount of turbines you will need to eat up all the plasma. You probably know about the XL Plasma Turbine, but you should also know that they force huge penalties on most plasmas, including Helium and Tin, if you use good turbine materials like Infinity. Do you remember those fusion chains mentioned in previous quests? This is the time for them. Check the GT++ tab for more details.

As you scale up, it's always worth it to look back at Helium Plasma for how renewable it is, something that Tin Plasma has unfortunately lost a bit of. It can be made renewable, but one of its strengths was in the Molecular Transformer recipe that transformed Tin, the output, into Silver, one of the inputs. This recipe is now in the new Molecular Transformer Multiblock and does not scale as well as before. Therefore it might be easier to use void miners for silver or to stick with Helium Plasma.

As per usual, running a lower tier recipe awards you with an overclock. Unlike other GT machines, though, the Fusion Reactor's overclock doubles both speed and energy consumption, which maintains the energy consumption per recipe but gives only half of a speed boost that a perfect overclock (like the Large Chemical Reactor) would.

ThePathofFusion-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUA==.json,3152,The Path of Fusion,"The most advanced nuclear technology there is to use in the pack is nuclear fusion. This is an event where two atoms collide with each other and fuse into a different atom while simultaneously generating energy from the plasma, when it is processed. It's impossible to perform in a reactor in real life, because the temperature requirements are too high to maintain any kind of reactor solid with decent efficiency. In GTNH, though, we have better materials.

The first Fusion Reactor can be built in late LuV, and each tier unlocks some material that is important to progress into the later tiers. Fusion crafting becomes important at that stage, for materials such as Europium, Americium, Neutronium and Oganesson, so you will want to dedicate reactors to specific things later on. More importantly, these materials come out as plasma, which needs to be cooled down to be turned into ingots and plates. On top of that, though, this cooling process is where you can get lots of power!

The usual process of power generation here is to pump EU into the Fusion Reactor. It needs enough energy to start the reaction, which will then proceed quickly and output good amounts of plasma. This plasma goes into Plasma Turbines, which output huge amounts of EU/t and the cooled down material, ready to be used in further crafting. A beginner's setup can output 640,000 EU/t from one reactor before overclocking, and this grows quickly over time. Fusion power dominates the game for several tiers due to its simplicity, receding away from the powergen setups that were getting more and more complicated with each tier. Two materials fuse into one, plasma comes out, goes into turbine and boom, lots of energy! It's like a steam tier powergen but with big numbers.

The maximum amount of heat you can safely move around in a reactor limits the amount of Uranium Fuel Rods you can use, which means that your HU value will not be as high as you would have wanted.

For regular and vacuum IC2 nukes, however, Uranium has a big advantage. Especially in vacuum nukes, which are the most powerful, the efficient cooling through the cells makes it so a lot of Uranium can be processed at once, which returns incredible amounts of EU/t.

The first one is the fuel. These fuel rods use a mixture of U238 and a bit of U235, which is rarer.

VacuumNukes-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMXw==.json,3167,Vacuum Nukes,"What's the next step, running nuclear reactors in a perfect vacuum? That would be pretty funny, I'd like to see that.

Disclaimer: this last step is not very stable. It's very risky to do it in servers with no backups, because it relies on redstone circuits to keep the reactor from exploding. Use multiple failsafes to guarantee safety. Never ever build a vacuum nuke in a Thermos server!

Vacuum nukes are an interesting GTNH-specific setup. They use only three components: fuel rods, platings to fill the empty slots for automation purposes, and coolant cells. Those cells you have used to make Energy Hatches, for example, they're used here to keep the reactor from overheating and exploding. The main difference this setup has is that these cells are consumable, and will wear out over time. You will need to add fresh cells into the reactor to keep running it safely, but the crux of the show is that you don't need to make new ones - you just need to cool them down again.

The Vacuum Freezer! That's why it's called a vacuum nuke! Elementary, my dear Steve. This kind of setup relies on using EU to refill the coolant cells, so to speak, and get much more EU from the reactor than you spend to keep it running. However, the redstone automation for this is quite tricky. If you just try it blindly, it might take you a long time to figure it out, and it might have explosive results. Check the Vacuum Reactors page on the wiki ([url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Vacuum_Reactors[/url]) if you want a detailed guide that goes far beyond what I could write in this quest description.

This quest task is for the last setup shown in the wiki, specifically the 8720-43600 EU, 40 Quad Uranium setup. As the title implies, it can produce up to 43600 EU/t, but it will require multiple filters and failsafes to run it safely.

Type in 'component.list()' this will display a table of all of .list from component. What we're looking for is gt_batterybuffer.
If you have too many nearby things it may not display and the way to search the entire list of components is too advanced for starters.

So now assign a variable to it; for example 'a = component.gt_batterybuffer'; now we can call 'a' to see what methods the batteryBuffer has.
What we'll be using in this example is the 'getBatteryCharge' method. So type  'a.getBatteryCharge(1)' this will call the method getBatteryCharge from the first inventory slot on the gt_batterybuffer in component.

So if we're using a 2x2 battery buffer; we can type something like, 'for i=1, 4 do print(a.getBatteryCharge(i)) end'
Poof you now see what all the batteries EU values. Now what can we do with this?

Try making a variable called 'batteryCharge = 0', now do 'for i=1, 4 do batteryCharge = batteryCharge + a.getBatteryCharge(i) end'

Now print(batteryCharge) will display the total charge. Here's a program example of this being used.

Place in your tape drive and type 'install', and follow the promps to install it into C. Then edit it, test it, figure how it works.

InfiniteEnergySt-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALmw==.json,2971,Infinite Energy Storage,"You shouldn't click on links from strangers! Although this sounds like clickbait it is true. From a certain point of view.

Use the (potential) force! And store energy that way. Simply construct a dam and flood vast areas with water. You may add energy to your storage by pumping more water into it or just drain it back into energy whenever you need. This works especially well with fluctuating energy sources like wind, water, and solar. Or you dump excess energy into it so you can use it another time. The capacity is huge and the choice is yours.

Sounds great! But...? - Indeed. There is a catch: Pumps and Turbines will have efficiency correlated loss. Still interested? Let's get to crafting!

The multi-block has an unusual shape: the back is open. The lake will spawn inside the multi-block and spread block-by-block as far as it can/is allowed. It will replace plants like water (make sure to secure your IC2 Crops!) but not replace any solid blocks. Additionally, you can specify limits in any direction. The water will NEVER spread past these limits. You can set those limits in a second GUI by right clicking the controller with a screwdriver.

When you enter a limit, it will correct itself to the nearest valid setting. Especially if you try to spread past the server limits. You may talk your admin into raising these limits (these limits are designed to limit griefing). Further, water is not able to spread into foreign towns.
You will also find 3 magical buttons in the top-right of this GUI. From left to right: The first will slowly despawn the lake blocks. You can use this to shrink the lake if it spread past a barrier for example. The multi-block will also initialize with this configuration so there is no accidental flooding. The second and third buttons will slowly spawn more lake blocks. Additionally, the second button will render those lake blocks pink so you see where they are so you may plug holes and such. In this ""debug"" mode you can walk/breathe/act in the lake like in air. This should make it easy to create a sunken village for decoration purposes. The third button is for normal operations so you can see the water and enjoy a swim in your energy buffer.

Of course, there is also a normal GUI (simple right-click). It shows you the energy stored in the dam. To reach higher water levels you are required to use stronger pumps. For this purpose, you may configure the voltage tier of the GUI with a circuit in the circuit slot. Don't worry: It is only optical. You cannot void any energy if you set a low voltage tier. It is only for the player information. You may give it a try with the reward you earn...

Are you tired of having to upgrade your cables constantly to handle different amperage amounts? Are you a fan of lightning bolts zapping around your base?

Then this multiblock is for you, the Telsa Tower comes with high amperage output and full TecTech energy hatch support with this powerful multiblock.

To get started you will need to fill the tower with capacitors matching the tier of the Primary Tesla Windings within the capacitor bank. The Tesla Winding determines the tier of power that the tower transfers power at and the amount of capacitors determines the maximum amperage that can be output. 

A total of 16 capacitors can be placed into one capacitor bank so you might need many banks depending on your power needs.

Once the tower is constructed click open the controller to configure the maximum transfer distance of the tower to fit the needs of your base. The range setting is currently buggy which means that at least for now you can do so without needing any plasmas. This option is called “Tesla Towers Transfer Radius Setting”.

Now that your tower is all configured how do you get power out of it to your machines? Well I am glad you asked. To get power to the machines of the base you will need to use the Tesla Coil Covers. Place them on your machines, energy hatches and even transformers to get power flowing from the tower. Energy hatches are a bit picky however and the hatch likes to be facing upwards to receive power.

[warn]Warning! The Tesla Tower will output only one tier of amp such as EV, IV etc. When upgrading the Primary Tesla Windings, please make sure to check that all of your coil covers and transceivers in the base can handle the upgraded power.

Make sure you don't put too many animals in the pen or they will overcrowd and kill each other. This happens to villagers as well.

Animals will prioritize moving towards grass blocks over any other blocks, and if there's no grass blocks around, they prefer lit blocks over dark blocks. You can encourage animals to stay in pens, or at least not crowd the edges, by removing grass from around both sides of the fence and under it, and by placing a torch in the center of the pen. For sheep that need the grass to eat, which reduces time to mature and replaces sheared wool instantly, place it in the center of a cleared out area with a border of non-grass.

Also, large quantities can cause server lag, especially if they are bumping into each other a lot. So if you are in multiplayer, make sure you limit animals to no more than roughly one per block for small entities like chickens and one per two blocks for large entities like cows.

Once you put an ore sample into the wand, it will tell you if this ore is nearby. When you get close to the target, you will hear the sound, and the wand will tilt down to the point of being upside-down if there's a lot of target ore nearby.

Use NEI to figure out which ore is the best for your search. If you don't have the needed ore, some basic ones can be purchased in the Coins tab. 

Open the wand's inventory with Shift+RMB when looking at the ground. Put the sample ore into the slot. 
The rod has a 60-block range both up and down, so it can miss a vein that is located very low or if you are above the sea level.

The rod appears to work based on the GT's Material system, so anything of the same material will work. 
That includes crushed ores, dusts, ingots, gems, rods, you name it. For things that don't belong to a particular Material, the rod appears to search only for that exact block - for instance, you won't detect a small ores with the usual ore block.

If the detected ore is a part of a vein, you will see a discovery message in the chat, and the vein will be automatically logged into the visual prospecting tab of your journey map.

The wand also works from inventory and hotbar, so you don't need to be actively holding it, but you get style points if you do.

The ore in the wand is stored with the player, not the wand. In other words, remove the ore if you want to give the wand to your teammate.

The year 2022 has just begun and the UEV tier, albeit still quite empty, has become more useful than before. UEV-UMV energy hatches now have proper recipes (although with UEV parts) and optical SMDs are a thing now, hooray. 
There finally are better powergen options than regular plasma turbine spam, namely naq fuel and compact fusions + XL plasma turbine spam. Technically dyson too, but that is horribly bugged and its 'legit' power output reasonably can't exceed around 6 billion eu/t (around the same as a compact MK4 running helium plasma).

P.P.S.: Again the chaotic capacitor banks have been left out for the same reason as stated in the UV gate quest. Oh and the stargate parts used to be UXV recipes, but since UMV hatches are not craftable in UEV anymore, they have been downtiered to UIV to make them craftable in UEV.

The solution? Using the sheer force of gravity. By using extreme amounts of explosive force on your fourth-dimensionally engineered tesseracts, you can tear tiny rifts in the fabric of space, enough to create a seed which can birth a black hole. If you can build a machine which can harness it, it will be able to compress even the strongest materials to the most dense states possible.

Taming a black hole is no easy task - even with all of your precautions, it defies your efforts to stabilize it and attempts to collapse itself constantly. Meaningfully extending the lifespan of the black hole will be extremely difficult. By bending spacetime through carefully aligned glass, you can reverse the flow of hawking radiation back into the black hole and keep it completely stable - problematically, however, the amount of spacetime required to maintain this process increases at an exponential rate.

As the black hole decays, it becomes even more powerful - but be wary, as it will eventually become unstable and you will no longer be able to recover your items from the edge of the event horizon. To safely close the black hole and restart this process, you have engineered a collapser out of the same fourth-dimensional materials.

With your newly acquired technology, you can now tap into these spaces in perfect sync, enabling your plasma forges to operate at incredible speeds.

The Transdimensional Alignment Matrix allows the DTPF to run with Perfect Overclocks. To achieve this, you need a full discount, and the extra power cost is offset by using more of the same catalyst.

Overall, it is more efficient and totally worth it.

This process is extremely catalyst-hungry. Ensure you're producing enough to sustain it.

For recipes without a catalyst, you must specify the catalyst in the GUI by right-clicking the Convergence button, otherwise it will default to Crude.[/note]

[note]Math for the curious:

To clear up what exactly happens in the background, here's an explanation on how the extra catalyst values are calculated using an example:

The example recipe of choice is the molten neutronium recipe using prosaic catalyst, running at 64A UMV (8,589,934,592 EU/t).
The recipe uses 14,753L of Prosaic catalyst and 36,484,545,600 EU per recipe without OCs or the catalyst discount. With the discount, the catalyst amount gets cut in half, meaning 7,376.5§ L of catalyst, which are rounded to 7,376L, and due to the 64A UMV the machine is supplied with the recipe overclocks 3 times, meaning each recipe actually uses 36,484,545,600 * 2^3 = 291,876,364,800 EU. 

Knowing the amount of OCs and the base voltage of the recipe, the difference of the needed EU per recipe with and without perfect OC can be calculated, that being 291,876,364,800 - 36,484,545,600 = 255,391,819,200 extra EU due to imperfect OCs.
To get the value of needed extra catalyst, this extra EU value has to be divided by the energy density of the relevant catalyst, prosaic in this case.

The division equates to 255,391,819,200 EU / 66,768,460 EU/L = 3,825.037 L, rounded to 3,825L extra prosaic catalyst per recipe. For the final step, this value has to be multiplied by 0.5 as its affected by the discount, meaning the total extra catalyst that gets added to the recipe is 3,825L * 0.5 = 1,912.5 L, rounded to 1,912L.

To summarise it all in a formula:
Amount extra catalyst per recipe = (B * ((2^x) - 1))/2L
where:
B is base total EU of the recipe
x is the number of overclocks
L is the EU/L of the relevant catalyst [/note]

Sphalerite and zinc are the primary sources of gallium at this tier.

You can find sphalerite in sulfur veins at Y 5-20, and the small zinc ores in the Overworld or the Nether at Y 80-210. You won't find much on the Overworld because of obvious reasons. To get additional zinc crushed ore drops, use a Tinker's Construct tool with the Luck (Fortune) enchant on it, probably the best use for all that lapis you got while looking for calcite. Or use a miner, if you don't mind how slow it is.

- Sphalerite can be electrolyzed for a small chance of a gallium dust. Better put in a lot or you might get unlucky.
- Zinc crushed ore can be washed and then thermal centrifuged or forge hammered and then centrifuged. But you don't always get the crushed ore as a drop, the impure dust doesn't give gallium.

You can get arsenic from realgar small ores in the Nether at Y 15-85. Centrifuge the dusts in a centrifuge.

Other sources are Tinker's Construct cobalt ore in the nether and cobaltite ore in the Twilight Forest. You can use your EBF for that. You also need to level up your pickaxe to ardite or make an Ironwood Pickaxe or LV Miner to harvest cobalt ore.

You will also need an EBF to turn the alumina into aluminium ingots. For that you need cryolite. Go visit the Twilight Forest for that and find a Cryolite vein. The related quest is ""Lead, Galena, Silver and Cryolite"" is the Novice Thaumaturgy tab.

Your second option is to use aluminium dust. However, you can not smelt that directly yet, even if you have an EBF. That will require higher heat levels.

One option is to switch to Light Fuel, discussed in LV. Another option is to use Benzene. Benzene is made from Wood Tar. There are a couple of pathways for that. Both start with logs from trees.  

One path is to use Coke Ovens or Advanced Coke Ovens to make charcoal, and fluid-extract Wood Tar from it. Then distill the Wood Tar to make Benzene. This method produces less pollution, but will also provide less Benzene.

The second path is to use the Pyrolyze Oven multiblock and Nitrogen gas to extract Wood Tar and Charcoal. Fluid-extract the Charcoal for additional Wood Tar. Then proceed as above. This method will create pollution from the Pyrolyze Oven, but will provide more Benzene per log.

Excess wood tar can also be turned into Toluene, a key ingredient for explosives that you'll need later on to make rockets.

You can feed into the Controller (and thus the rest of the drawers) with any kind of piping or hopper equivalent. If using it as part of a Multifarm or Mob Farm, make sure to set the contents of the drawers, and lock them with a key so that it properly stores everything in an organized manner. If the drawers' contents aren't set, it will start filling starting from the ones closest. If you wish to have more than one drawer full of an item, put a void upgrade on the drawer further from the Controller, and it will fill the first one, then the second.

If you want to go around corners, use the Trim Drawers to extend the multiblock. If you want to have a second point to dump items into, use the Controller Slave (one per multiblock, automation only). Note that you can use a key on the Controller to affect all drawers at once.

The Glowstone rod will slowly charge up if you put it next to any fuel rod in your IC2 reactor. The exact charging speed is `(number of rods adjacent) * (floor(hull temperature/3000) + 1)` per second. A dual rod will count as 2 rods and quad fuel rod will count as 4 rods for this purpose. The Glowstone rod will neither emit heat, nor cause other component to emit more heat. You can treat this rod as a reactor plating in the IC2 Reactor Planner.

As you can see, the speed is directly proportional to hull temperature and rods adjacent. At the very extreme you can fully charge up a Glowstone rod in less than half a minute and output one Sunnarium every 10 second (on average, since cells aren't charged at same speed due to different position), but that require very considerable resource to setup. It also involves a vacuum freezer to cooldown the coolant cells and running the reactor at 66000+ hull temperature. Balance your need and your resource situation wisely.

You could centrifuge it at a horrible chance rate with a long recipe but there are better ways of obtaining it.

The better ways are processing chains that can be made in three different paths with the third path being unlocked at a further stage after obtaining Fusion with the Neutron Activator.

The first path requires the chemical plant multiblock that you might not be familiar with but will become required to create rocket fuel for any tier three or higher rocket. This path is the fastest with only two steps to obtain the Thorium 232, but requires borax which can only be obtained (for now) through mining salt veins as a byproduct or through bees (probably the better option if you already have some).

The second path is a six step processing chain that requires Chemical Reactors, a Centrifuge, and an EBF. Even though it is longer it offers much better conversion ratio (75% instead of 25% in chemical plant), instead of borax it requires nitric acid (4000L per dust if you account for recycling) and 100L of fluorine per dust.

Either way I would recommend using AE2FC as it allows on demand fluid crafting which will assist in both processing chains.

QuantumComputer-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH1w==.json,2007,Quantum Computer,"The Quantum Computer (QC) is an incredibly complicated machine used to generate computation for the Research Station and a few other multiblocks. There are a few things you need to understand before using one.

§lCONSTRUCTION§r. Much like an assembly line, the QC is built as a series of slices. The first and last slice are the only valid locations for hatches. The slices in between are primarily for computer racks. The Multiblock Structure Hologram Projector shows the minimum length QC, but holding multiple in a single stack will show/build longer versions up to the maximum length of 16. There is also a mandatory air block in front of the computer heat vents.

§lOUTPUT§r. Computation is nothing more than an integer input for certain recipes--much like EU. There may exist a minimum throughput requirement, a threshold to reach, or both (NEI will tell you everything). Computation is generated every second by the QC, transmitted by an Optical Transmission Connector, received by an Optical Reception Connector, and ""consumed"" by the machine or process that needs it. There is no storing computation and there can only be ONE transmission or reception hatch connected to the same Optical Fiber Cables at a time. If absolutely necessary, the Network Switch with QOS can split/join connections but know that it takes both power and maintenance to run.

Additional QC can be chained together using another set of Optical Transmission and Optical Reception Connectors between machines, but they cannot wallshare the same Optical Transmission Connector.

§lUNCERTAINTY§r. The QC has a unique maintenance requirement that can only be corrected by balancing the Schrödinger Matrix inside an Uncertainty Resolver--an additional hatch that must go on either the first or last slice of the machine. Start with the basic Uncertainty Resolver, but know that there are two more tiers unlocked later on that lower the difficulty of the puzzle, or not?

The interface of the Uncertainty Resolver has the Schrödinger Matrix in the middle and two sets of 8 buttons on the left and right. Clicking on one button and then another will switch the states of the two corresponding cells in the matrix. This means switching their blinking speed (in the basic Uncertainty Resolver) or their shade/color (in the Uncertainty Resolver X). The goal of the puzzle is to balance the states of the matrix around the glowing LED lights, turning all of them green.

§lPARAMETERS§r. In the GUI of the controller, there are two configurable parameters, overclock and overvolt, that change how computation and heat are generated. Higher overclock values contribute the most to computation and higher overvolt values contribute the most to heat. Alone, this would encourage the player to make overclock as high as possible and overvolt as low as possible, but there is a penalty to computation for large differences between these two parameters. Furthermore, overvolt values <1 will cause the QC to randomly drop computation proportional to its distance from 1. It is highly encouraged to play around with these parameters, as all the best setups do.

See the adjacent quest for more information on computer racks and generating computation.",量子计算机,"[2628, 2006]",量子计算机,"这是一台复杂得不可思议的机器,它会为你的研究站提供""算力(Computation)"".首先你需要备齐一些东西:量子计算机主方块、未定元解析器、一些电路板和容纳它们的电脑机箱、以及一个大能源仓(一开始可以用4A-UV能源仓).需要这么大的能源仓是因为量子计算机本身需要1A-UV,而每个机箱都会再增加1A-UV的能源需求.另一个要点是,只在研究站中有需要扫描的配方时才打开量子计算机,这样可以避免过多的能量损失.记得先打开量子计算机再打开研究站.想要构建这台科学怪兽,你需要在至少高于地面1格处放下量子计算机主方块,然后对着主方块使用全息投影仪,这将为你提供大量信息和各种类似幽灵的方块-显示相应的机械方块或仓室需要放在何处. 注意靠近散热机械方块的没有点的幽灵方块表示此处必须留空.后期你会需要一台更大的量子计算机.使用一组全息投影仪即可看到建造提示.如果在某些极端情况下,一台最大尺寸,拥有24个机箱的量子计算机都不够用了,你还可以连接多台量子计算机构成阵列. 不过现在,让我们先造一台基础款.未定元解析器:一个比较让人摸不着头脑的小游戏.你的目标是平衡焦点周围的光块.有时候,运行一段时间后,这种薛定谔状态会再次出现问题,需要再次解谜方可继续运行.这种情况是随机的,令人非常沮丧,尤其是在研究站和量子计算机之间进行操作时,所以在量子计算机运行过程中,不时查看未定元解析器十分重要. 如果谜题看起来太难,拆除未定元解析器和控制器方块并重新放置,这样就能刷新谜题了.计算机箱(Computer-Racks):此多方块结构中产生算力的主要部件.想要正确使用机箱,你需要放入一些电路板和散热片;高级散热片效果最佳.重点就是,你要使用散热片来防止热量达到灾难性的程度.机箱会在热量达到约9000(也可以写作90％,而10000热量即为100％)后熔毁或爆炸,但大多数电路板的阈值要低得多(即达到此阈值后,电路板熔毁,热量停止上升).对于我们在这里的例子,终极晶体电脑,任何超过54％的热量都会导致其熔毁(为了机箱安全)! 不同电路板的最大热量不同,即便是同等级的不同电路板也是如此.你可以通过扫描单独机箱,获知其内电路板的热量参数. 在散热完毕之前,你无法移动电路板和散热片. 在控制器的GUI中也可以看到热量. 最重要的是：千万不要在散热完毕之前拆卸机箱. 否则,BOOM! 算力(Computation):算力每秒生成一次,而算力的大小取决于机箱中的电路板等级和数量.然而,在生成多少算力之间存在差异,即使使用相同的等级的电路板也是如此.例如,大型量子电脑(量子系列电路板中的LuV等级)与湿件处理器(湿件系列电路板中的LuV等级)相比,湿件处理器可以提供更多的算力,虽然它们等级相同.如果你想获知一种电路板能提供的精确算力,你可以放下一个电脑机箱,放进去一个电路板然后扫描它.总算力也可以在控制器的GUI中看到.扫描结果会包含以下信息.基础算力(Base-computation):没啥好说的...超频后算力(After-overclocking):数字一般和上面一样,除非你特意使其超频蓄热(Heat-Accumulated):这个数字取决于电路板和散热片,注意这个参数,它非常重要.你也可以在GTNH的wiki上找到关于电路板最大热量和算力生成的概述.通过GUI中的参数窗口,你可以手动超频或过压,不过不是太必要,感兴趣的话可以试试.为研究站提供算力:在量子计算机的可变位置安装主光学接口,并在研究站上安装副光学接口. 使用光缆将它们连接起来,并把三者涂上相同颜色.示例：现在,你已经了解了操作计算机箱的基础概念和安全条例(在启动量子计算机前扫描机箱!),但你的量子计算机最理想的配置是什么?要知道,每秒128的最低算力已经可以满足相当部分的研究站配方了.我们建议使用两个4格机箱,均放入1个高级散热片和3个终极晶体电脑(ZPM),一共可以提供每秒156算力.与一些更复杂的配置相比,这是一个性价比相当高的配置.不过这也仅仅是一种最低需求的配置,之后你应该会考虑优化(或扩大)本配置!既然你已经了解了一部分理论知识,是时候构建你自己的量子计算机了!这需要消耗巨量的资源.译者注:运行过程中不要拆掉任何方块,否则就会爆炸!

QuantumMechanics-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKiw==.json,2699,Quantum Mechanics is Hot,"The QC has 2-24 computer racks depending on the length of the machine. Each rack has four total slots for either circuits (to generate heat and computation) or vents (to dissipate heat). Although conceptually similar to a nuclear reactor, the location of the components inside does not matter at all. Every rack is also completely independent from every other rack which means it is not possible to have one rack with all circuits and another with all vents.

The computation of a rack is the sum of all the components' individual computation. For example, two APU (Tier 3) and two Cooling Cores have 240 + 240 + 0 + 0 = 480 base computation per second. However, computation changes significantly depending on the values for overclock and overvolt:

[note]Computation = Base * (1+overclock^2) / (1+(overclock-overvolt)^2)[/note]

The heat of a rack is a value between 0 and 10,000 and is reported in the interface of the QC or by using a Portable Scanner on the rack. Every component has a certain heat limit which if exceeded will void that component. Breaking or wrenching a rack while it is hot (>2000) will similarly void the components inside. The QC will explode if the heat exceeds 10,000 but no component has a heat limit greater than that, so don't worry too much about ruining your base.

[note]Heat α HeatConstant * overclock * overvolt^2[/note]

The power consumption of a rack is 1A ZPM regardless of the components inside. This is in addition to the 1A ZPM of the QC itself. However, these EU/t values are directly proportional to overclock and overvolt which should increase as you unlock better circuits. Be sure to turn on the QC before the research station and only when you need it.

[note]EU/t = 131,072 * overclock * overvolt * (racks + 1)[/note]

To get you started, craft 4x APU (Tier 3) and 4x Cooling Cores. Place two of each component in the two racks and the QC will safely produce 1,920 computation/s for just 393,215 EU/t (0.75A UV) which is more than enough for researching the Wetware Mainframe. If you would like to further increase the computation/s at the cost of power, adjust the overclock and overvolt values to 1.44 and 1.03, respectively. This will generate 2,526 computation/s at a cost of 583,217 EU/t (1.11A UV).

If the APUs are too bothersome to craft, try Crystalprocessor Mainframes instead but you will need different overclock and overvolt values to get the most out of them. That goes for every unique combination of circuits and vents.",计算机箱,[2007],再来一次,"一台量子计算机很酷,再来一台怎么样? 你可以像连接研究站一样将两台量子计算机连接起来,以获得更多算力. 初始计算机需要有一个副光学接口以获取第二台计算机的数据.当然,这有点贵,所以实际上还有另一种选择,就是简单地扩展初始计算机. 你可以拆除计算机的最后两片,然后用堆叠两个的""多方块结构全息投影图""查看如何建造一台4机箱计算机. 但是,4机箱计算机需要另一个UV能源仓或者更高阶能源仓,因为它的耗电是5A-UV. 如果有必要的话,可以建造最多12片、包含24个机箱的量子计算机.只需要往结构中间加上更多片,或者用堆叠超过12个的投影图看结构.如果你有3个机箱,每个机箱中有3个晶体处理器主机和1个高级散热片,那么产生的算力就足以用来研究UEV电路板,而且也不会过热.第三个满足高算力的选项是从头了解参数仪的工作原理.有了它,你可以对量子计算机的最大发热进行更精细的控制,并获取一切参数.记住在调整之前要先将量子计算机的所有热量散去."

Initially, your Space Elevator has 6 module slots that can be used. You can later upgrade that to up to 12 with Mk-II and Mk-III motors. The motor tier also determines the module tier that you can use. The I/O is not shared between modules, each module only sees their own I/O slots. Energy is only provided to the central structure of the Space Elevator and then automatically distributed to all modules.

After a module has been inserted and supplied with the right I/O, it can be configured further using parameters.

You can see in NEI which fluids are pumpable with the Space Pumping Module. It consumes 1A UHV to work. The Gas Type and Planet Type are parameters.

NEI also has an overview of all the ores you can obtain with a Space Mining Module. It needs to supplied with a drone, which will act as catalyst, a set of input items, computation and either Helium, Bismuth or Radon plasma. The plasma will boost both the recipe time and the amount of bonus stacks you get out of a recipe. With its parameters you can adjust parallels, overdrive, and distance. When multiple recipes have the same input and you have the distance set to a value that they share, the module will pick a random one, taking the recipes weights into consideration.

The space elevator also lets you travel to other planets, but it doesn't get you back though so better keep that in mind! 

The mining module also got a cycle mode. In static mode it will hold its distance while in cycle mode it will change its distance after each recipe check (and you can configure the range and step size of that).

Yes, there's multiple of them, one for each major iteration of the stargate recipe. 
These trophies are just that, trophies, and you can try to craft them if you want to compare the costs to today's stargate standards.
To complete these quests you have to submit two stargates' worth of materials.

§3Now, let me bestow upon you a short history lesson about this point in GT:NHs past.

The year is 2020. The bio mainframe was pretty much the end of GT:NH progression at the time, not much above UHV existed or was craftable. This was also the point in the pack where you'd start scaling for stargate, as that too was tiered at UHV. Technically UEV parts were craftable, but their only uses were singleblocks for PAs (which only held up to 16 UEV machines) and the Deep Dark Portal. UEV-UMV energy hatches were craftable, but their recipes were simple hull + wire crafting table recipes 
...and that was about it for UHV+ content. 
With the recent addition of void miners, the previously thought to be impossible started to seem actually attainable, a set of stargates. Specifically, to §ocraft§3 a set of them, not just find them like others have before. 

One group in particular, known as the §aGigaplex§3, gave it their all and actually managed to do it, to prove that crafting stargates is possible with enough determination.

Thus, on the §a16th of February, 2021§3, the first set of crafted stargates had been born.

P.S.: If you want to be as faithful to the challenge as possible, try completing this quest without using any of the modern functionality that didn't exist back then.
Here's a non-exhaustive list of major things that didnt exist (in no particular order):
-PCB Factory, Space Elevator, Component Assemblyline, AAL, PrAss, EEC, EIG, Compact Fusions, MCR, MABS
-Any bee related GT machines
-Any UEV or above multis
-XL Turbines, Naq fuel, LEG
-Sub 1-tick OC, Batch Mode, inbuilt Void Protection on multis
-PAs with more than 64 parallel (they automatically downtiered to UHV if you used UEV machines)
-Level Maintainer, AE Fluid Crafting, Stocking Buses/Hatches, Crafting Input Buses, ME Output Buses/Hatches, non-recursive AE component recipes
-Shift clicking recipes into AE patterns (pain)
-Early-Midgame QoL such as ghost circuits, visual prospecting, reprogramming circuits with a screwdriver, seeing Assline recipes in NEI before having crafted them, and more

P.P.S: This quest is missing the chaotic capacitors on purpose, because the chaotic core recipe requires spacetime now, but the chaotic capacitor recipe did not change at all since then. All in all the cost for these banks was completely negligible back then and still is today, they only serve as a magic gate for SG.",官方GT玩家勋章,[2665],,

SolderingsNotWor-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKdw==.json,2679,Soldering's Not Working Anymore,"After all these advancements, it looks like some things just aren't meant to be. Every machine that your Assembly Line has crafted works, but the most advanced ones so far seem to be... a bit rough around the edges. Further inspection revealed that Indalloy just isn't good enough. It seems that Infinity's neverending vibrations destabilize the joints where the soldering happens, your living circuits have been offering resistance to this crude soldering alloy, however that happens...

It's likely that new materials will completely break Indalloy's ability to get pieces soldered together. Because of that, it's about time for a new development in this technology, and the previous rejection by your living circuits has given you an excellent idea. Any new material can have some new behavior that will ruin assembling for you, but what if the solder itself learns about these complications and learns how to adjust to them, mutating for them?

That's right: §aMutated Living Solder§r.

This sort of chemistry is only possible in a full-scale Chemical Plant, equipped with the most advanced casing: Botmium. On top of that, the catalyst you need to use has been consumed so thoroughly that you were forced to use Infinity for it, on top of the mutating Naquadria. Your Infinity will be lost to the crafting, still, unless you manage to put [note]Tungstensteel Pipe Casings[/note] and [warn]Awakened Draconium Coils[/warn] in your Chemical Plant, which prevent the catalyst from losing durability. Any better coils also have the same effect.

The new solder itself is a different story. Wetware technology is too primitive for this, and your Bio Cells have refused to bond with any fluid that would serve as its carrier for soldering. When you tried a mixture of hot Tin and Bismuth, it finally worked, but the soldering didn't actually work. It looked like the Bio Cells hadn't learned how to fulfill their new job, which could be fixed by adding an example material as a test subject, something simpler like Infinity Catalyst... but it seemed impossible to bond the cells to the dust. You need more energy... not just loads of EU, something concentrated, hot, fizzling with energy!

Yes, everything alive died instantly when you decided to add plasmas instead of hot fluids. No surprise there. However, Bio Cells did survive inside hot fluids, so we just need some temperature control here, and some separation between cell and plasma... yes, Gravi Stars can be used for this. We still need to cool down the plasmas, so that the enhanced cells can mix with them in liquid form, and EU alone would be too expensive. Gelid Cryotheum has proven to be surprisingly efficient, perhaps due to its origins, as a component of a living being, the Blizz.

There we go! The Mutated Living Solder is now complete. The highly intelligent Bio Cells are energized by the concentrated heat of the plasmas, while keeping a distance from them due to the Gravi Stars' influence, and they analyze the Infinity Catalyst Dust to learn about material instability. This is a very slow process, but it happens at the same time as the plasmas are slowly cooled, using Cryotheum and EU, until the learning process is complete and the Bio Cells fall into the Tin and Bismuth, now in the liquid form that was shown to work before. Finally, armed with their new knowledge, the cells flow through the Naquadria-based, Infinity-reinforced catalyst so that they can mutate in real-time after researching the material they're soldering.

This should work for any future soldering need, regardless of material. Let's hope so, at least...",突变活性焊料单元,"[2659, 2675, 2696]",外协焊料,"某些高新材料焊接起来比较困难.但也许你开发的新-生物技术焊料可以搞定? 你创造出的这种活性焊料完全可以胜任!它能适应任何挑战,并从原子级填补材料间隙!使用博特姆合金级化工厂制造突变活性焊料.催化剂配方需要无尽,所以最好将你的化工厂升级到钨钢管道方块,以及至少觉醒龙线圈才能让催化剂免于损耗."

Your first step is to make the Barnardafis culture, then the DNA Sample, and then the Data Orb. If you didn't grab the saplings and dirt previously (to grow more trees for logs), head back to Barnarda C.

Use the same recipe as for the General Purpose one, but use the Data Orb for Barnardafis instead of Common Yeast. You should get the Barnardafis Plasmid.

Again, it's the same recipe for the next step, but with the TCetiEis Fucus Serratus culture and the Barnardafis Plasmid, this should produce the Xenoxene Xenoxis culture. It's a 7.5% chance.

You should probably use the normal alternative recipe to make more cultures, since it's easy to fail copying it too.

You should be able to figure out yourself how to make Xenoxene once you have the culture.

AutomatingPowerO-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGdg==.json,1654,§6§lAutomating Power On/Off,"Once you have a GT boiler or Large Combustion Engine with a long startup time, you may wish to automate turning it on/off to save fuel, since extra power or Steam will just be voided. Additionally, the bigger your Steam/EU buffer is, the less time your generators will spend heating up, which makes them more efficient. 

Use a Machine Controller Cover on the controller for that. You can put it on top, bottom, or sides next to a casing - casings will transmit the redstone signal. You can use a Soldering Iron and Fine Soldering Alloy Wire to set the Redstone Output of a controller block to strong. When set to Strong it can go through a casing, but not hatches, buses, or other blocks. Use it with an activity detector if you want to receive a signal from the controller rather than turning it on/off with one.

With a Machine Controller Cover, you can use redstone to turn the machine on and off. This is handy if you don't want to use a Soft Hammer to disable a machine yourself constantly.
 
The best way to do that is with an RS latch. One input will turn the machine on, and one input will turn the machine off. Use a comparator attached to a valve to measure the steam level in your multiblock Iron or Steel Tank. Invert the signal to turn on your boiler when the steam level is low. When the steam level signal is high, turn your boiler off. Use a trail of redstone to lower the signal strength. Because of boiler/turbine warmup, try to set the ON strength to 30 percent of capacity and OFF strength to about 90 percent.

Red alloy wire will hold a redstone signal for a longer distance than normal redstone, while redstone conduits will go indefinitely. You can also use amplified redcrystal to improve the strength of the signal for a long distance, repeating as necessary. 

You can use a Energy Detector Cover in Normal Electrical Storage (including batteries) mode to monitor the power in a battery buffer and use it to enable/disable generators in a similar way. Change mode using a screwdriver. If you use a dense redcrystal, it will only allow signal through at a certain level, perfect for automating this kind of thing.

You can use MCCs on more than just generators though, you can use it on any multiblock and most singleblocks. This is useful to prevent voiding of materials. Unlike GT++ multies that will halt if full, a non-GT++ multi will void the items or liquids and keep on working, potentially voiding huge amounts of materials. You'll want to use them in combination with Fluid or Item Detection Covers on the output hatch or bus.

CoveringUp-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALDw==.json,2831,Covering Up,"This quest goes over all of the covers, just in case you forgot or they weren't mentioned. If they have their own quest, look at it for more info. You can put them on basically any GT block, pipe, machine, tank, etc. Though that doesn't consider whether it will work right or be useful. Shift-Right-Click will open a GUI for many of them. For covers that you can adjust the amount of, clicking the left side with a screwdriver goes down, and right goes up. All covers block rain on the side they're attached to. Generally you can adjust covers with a screwdriver, whether they have a GUI or not. You can remove them with a crowbar if you forgot.

§lFluid-Related Covers:§r
Pump: Transfers fluids at the speed specified on the tooltip.

Fluid Regulator: Regulates the rate that fluid can go through it, as well as pumping it. Can work x/s or x/t.

Steam Valve: Moves more, but is only for steam. Only goes to IV. Does not work on SH steam.

Overflow: Voids anything over the specified amount in the tank.

Fluid Detector: Will emit a redstone signal (RS) based on fluid fill rate of the tank it's on. By default, empty=15, full=0. Use inverted mode to swap. Useful on tanks and hatches.

Ender Fluid Link: Cover version of ender tanks to TP fluid around. Doesn't connect to ender tanks though.

Drain Module: Protects from rain on that side, and will fill the tank with water from rain if it can. Useless.

Fluid Filter: Filters fluid going through it. Click with a cell to set it.

Shutter: Blocks items/fluids when active. Use it with a machine controller and RS. Does not visually disconnect/block. You place it between the pipes, and put the MC on the same pipe.

§lItem-Related Covers:§r
Conveyor: Sends items. Use an item pipe in import mode or on a GT block/machine.

Robot Arm: Sends from a specific slot in the machine it's on (internal) to another specific slot in a block next to it (adjacent). Keep going through numbers until you get it right, it seems to change per machine. If the output slot is full, it won't output. There need to be a valid block with slots to send to or the settings won't save.

Item Detector: Will emit RS based on item fill rate of the block it's on. By default, empty=0, full=15. Detects by filled slots, so doesn't work right with the super/quantum chests. Probably better for busses.

Item Filter: This one is work-in-progress that is not yet finished. Feel free to contribute.

§lEU-Related Covers:§r
Energy Detector: Will emit RS based on EU fill rate of the batbuff/tank it's on. By default, empty=0, full=15. Make sure to set it to include batteries. Can also detect steam for some reason.

Power Pass Upgrade: Read the tooltip, then ask Bart how it works, he didn't bother telling anyone. He'll probably just tell you the code is the best documentation, just like the Tectech guys. May not actually be finished/work, either.

Tesla Coil/Tesla Coil Rich Edition: Use with the tesla tower to send EU wirelessly or something. 

§lOther Covers:§r
Player Detector: Detects players. About 10 block range. [warn]Currently owner/other is inverted on non-pipes due to some bug or another.[/warn]

Activity Detector: Detects either recipe progress or idleness. 0%=0 RS, ~95%=14 by default. In idle mode, idleness is 15, and is 0 when running by default.

Machine Controller: Turns machine on/off based on RS. Disable machine will keep it off regardless of RS state. Safe Mode only works on MBs. If a MB runs out of power, it will normally turn off, but a MC will turn it back on, continuing to void stuff. This will set it to the disable machine state instead. You will also get a notification. [warn]Safe mode is currently broken?[/warn]

Needs Maintenance: Emits RS if it meets the condition specified. Rotor=turbine?

Redstone Transmitter/Receiver (In/Out): OK, these things are confusing, so listen closely. First, set a frequency, either by using the GUI, or using the original way: right clicking it with an item. Empty hand = 0, other items = their item ID. Be careful not to reset it to 0 by accident. Honestly, just use the GUI. You can set it to private or not, it's the same kind of thing as EnderStorage, so you don't blare RS across the server. Channel state = RS level.

RT(O) sets the channel state based on the redstone level sent from outside to the specific side. You can TP a RS from this to the RR(O).
RT(I) sets the channel state based on redstone level that would be emitted from the machine itself. [warn]Always sends 15, so it's useless.[/warn]
RR(O) outputs redstone level based on channel state. You can TP RS from the RT(O) to here.
RR(I) controls whether a machine can work based on channel state, just like a machine controller cover does. If it has 0 RS, it stays off. At least 1, and it turns on. You send the signal from elsewhere with the RT(O).
RR(I) can also be used in conjunction with other covers whose states talk about conditional.

IC2 Heat vents: Speeds up machines a tiny amount? Also looks neat. TODO: someone please look at the code to see what it actually does.

Crafting Table: Adds a crafting table to the block you can use. Mostly cosmetic.

Planks/Plates/Foils: Blocks I/O on that side. Use a screwdriver to set allowed types of stuff through. Blocks everything by default. Set the output to another side first to avoid changing its settings too. You'll probably 'use' this by accident at least once.

Computer Monitor: Adds a visual look. Cosmetic-only cover.

Lens: Cosmetic-only cover.

You can do a small Chemical Reactor chain to do this line of recipes, but the better option is to make an LCR and use the circuit 24 recipe to turn Ammonia and Oxygen directly into Nitric Acid.

You'll still need to automate Ammonia, though, and there are two main ways of doing this. One of the options is to create it directly from Nitrogen and Hydrogen, but this recipe consumes a lot of EU. The other option is to switch to the biological side of things and get it from the DT recipe of Fermented Biomass, but this requires a whole another setup with sapling automation, a Pyrolyse Oven and some other machines, so don't do it unless you're interested in getting the other outputs of that recipe.

BasicCracking-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALsQ==.json,2993,Basic Cracking,"Despite what the Distillery recipe might have led you to believe, there are many more fractions of Oil than the four you could choose from. However, to get the rest of the oil byproducts, you need to split these four into the others, a process known as cracking. To crack the fuels, they must not be sulfuric, and you will need either Hydrogen (hydro-cracking) or Steam (steam-cracking) to successfully crack. Your Hydrogen source for desulfurizing is hopefully good enough to sustain hydro-cracking, and the Steam you were previously using for power can now be useful to get more out of the Oil you're pumping.

Heavy Fuel, Light Fuel, Refinery Gas and Naphtha can each be cracked both ways, and with three different intensities: lightly, moderately or severely cracked. This means that each portion has 6 different cracking options, and the products of distilling them can be cracked once more! There are a lot of options here, but a few of them stand out for their usefulness.

The first one you should try is Refinery Gas. In order to make that, you will need to desulfurize Sulfuric Gas, so make some of that in your Distillery. Currently, you can only crack through the Chemical Reactor, so once you have the Refinery Gas grab some steam and get cracking. 

*Hint* You should start by making some Severely-Cracked Refinery Gas

The Large Boilers you might have looked at before, and perhaps used, change when you reach Titanium, and if you build one of those, you will get something quite different from the tiers before.

To start, most burnable items don't work here. These advanced boilers need to burn much hotter, and as such they only accept specific fuels. The fuel of interest here is one of two, who are built in a sort of chain, in a similar fashion as to how Diesel and CBD worked. There is Solid Super Fuel, and Magic Solid Super Fuel, and they are both created from some coal-like block, some binder and some liquid fuel. You can use CBD for this, but Heavy Fuel and LPG are also options.

Why go through this route, though? The answer is that this extra processing, although it is difficult to automate, creates fuel that is much more efficient than the fuels that were put into it, and this is because the advanced Large Boilers are slow burners that output Superheated Steam, instead of regular one. This also means that they will need two turbines to convert all the steam into EU, and even more if the amount produced is too much for them.

Diesel-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALtw==.json,2999,Diesel,"Finally, the oil of the gods. At least, early gods.

Diesel, as a power source, has widely been known as the optimal choice all the way up to EV, when you unlock the ability to make nukes. It can be further upgraded into Cetane-Boosted Diesel in HV, by adding another chemical chain to it, but a fuel value of 480k EU on a fuel that needs so few machines to be made is quite exceptional. It should be automated as soon as possible, to ensure that you won't run out of power when you need it the most.

At this stage, you can use either LV or MV Diesel Generators. Using the LV ones will mean you need to make more of them, and more pollution, but they have 95% fuel efficiency compared to MV's 90%.

DistillationTowe-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALrA==.json,2988,Distillation Tower,"In HV, your oil processing options soar to new levels of complexity, and efficiency. Many of the processing multis that can be used are unlocked in this tier, and one of the most iconic is the Distillation Tower, the direct upgrade of the Distillery.

This tower can do actual fractional distillation, a process used in real life petrochemistry to separate oil into many different parts, based on their boiling points. The tall structure is required for the process, because the condensation of the vapours occurs in different temperatures. And since heating is only applied at the bottom, temperature drops the higher the vapour travels. This means that compounds with higher boiling points will condense sooner and will end up lower in the column, the opposite is also applicable for compounds with low boiling points.

That said, the Distillation Tower replaces Distilleries by allowing you to collect all fractions at once, from the same amount of input. This means that the tower is both more efficient, and also allows automation of all the outputs at the same time, but this comes at a cost: the controller needs EV circuits, which require a built Cleanroom, and the structure blocks are mostly made of Stainless Steel. Not only that, but the tower's height depends on the recipe, since each output needs its own height level to successfully be extracted. A max-height, 12-block tall DT can cost almost a dozen stacks of stainless to build, a very expensive multi for the tier.

Instead of doing that, the first DT you should build is a 5-block tall one, to distill the Oil you're pumping out of reservoirs.

However, this one doesn't use the previous fuel, and instead takes a different oil-based route, which means that the CBD you have is of no use in this processing chain.

Also as before, the amount of processing you will need is greatly increased, and you can expect to need a lot more DTs, Oil Crackers, LCRs and other machines. You will also have to automate the input of materials from other sources, since Oil cannot provide you with everything anymore. You can overclock the multis you have, or build more of them, your choice. In the end, you'll have a fuel that is 2.5x more powerful than CBD, at an impressive fuel value of 2.5 million EU, and more byproducts than you could ever imagine. 

You might have to crack one of the four oil fractions into the other ones, and you will surely need to pump Oil faster and faster to keep up with the power needs that will come when jumping to IV. I do recommend you use AE2 to automate the setup, relying on fluid P2Ps to transport fluids around, because it will make your life easier, even if it's harder to start and learn the setup.

Remember what I said before about higher initial investments being worth it?

That said, there isn't a new oil processing chain in IV, you only improve what you already have. If there was a step in the chain that was running too slow, and you needed to add more machines to it or overclock, it's likely that there is now a multi that can take over that role by itself.

UsingAlltheFract-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALuQ==.json,3001,Using All the Fractions,"After getting large amounts of all the oil fractions, what can you do with them? They'll pile up in the tanks or output hatches, and the Distillation Tower stop when it filles, unless you enable fluid voiding in the controller - in which case everything that cannot be output will just be voided instead, and it's in your best interest to avoid this waste. What do, then?

First off, it's important to note that almost everything you get from Oil can be processed into even more things. Whether or not the step is worthwhile is a different story altogether. That said, you're free to look through NEI or the spreadsheet to decide what you want to do, and how you want to do it. The charm of a processing chain like this is that it lets you choose your own path and gives you the information to know how to best utilize it.

Second off, Oil is a major source of byproducts, many of which are needed to create various important materials. However, this isn't the only way to obtain most of them, and you might already found other sources, especially if you've dabbled in the Benzene or the Biomass chains. Which path you take is up to you.

Now, for the four fractions that you get from regular Oil. Up until now, the power generation needed both Light Fuel and Heavy Fuel processing, and Refinery Gas already proved to be a good source of Ethylene. What can these be used for, in case you can build more DTs to process the cracked fluids? Roughly speaking, these are the possibilities:

Light Fuel: You will most likely be using most, or all of this to make Diesel. If you do have leftovers, moderately hydrocracking it is a good source of Propene, and lightly hydrocracking is the best source for Octane. These two are important, but only in EV, for epoxy and powergen, specifically.

Heavy Fuel: If only working with regular Oil, a lot of this will also be consumed to make Diesel. However, it's important to get more of it automated, since it can be distilled directly to make three fantastic byproducts: Toluene, Phenol and Benzene. All of them are important for progression, so make sure you pay attention to this recipe. Toluene is especially useful in HV, as you will need many buckets of it when making your first rocket to be able to get into EV.

Naphtha: You could distill it in a Distillation Tower, but keep in mind that you need to build a max-height one to cover the entire recipe. However, if you do it, you will have most of the Oil byproducts automated meaning that it's worth it to tackle this challenge when you get comfortable with making lots of Stainless Steel; it also has a good burn value, so if you don't need these byproducts, best just use it for power.

Refinery Gas: You're probably already distilling this for Ethylene. You could switch this recipe to a Distillation Tower and a Oil Cracking Unit (see next quest) to gain more output and some useful byproducts.",金币,[2988],利用所有组分,"在提炼出石油的所有组分之后,玩家会用它们做什么呢?这些蒸馏出的组分会囤积在储罐或输出仓中,而蒸馏塔就算没有输出空间仍会持续运行;而无法输出的任何产物都会被直接销毁,所以如何避免这种浪费是你首先需要考虑的.然后呢?首先,非常值得注意的是,你从石油中提炼出的几乎所有的组分,都可以继续加工成为各种化工产品.当然,组分是否值得继续处理需要自己判断,大部分都是不值的.换句话说,你可以查阅NEI或者数据表格,自由决定你的目标产物及其加工路线.这正是石化处理的魅力所在,至少对我来说是这样的,各种所需的信息都提供给你了,你可以自由选择,寻找最优的路线.其次,石油是GTNH化工体系的基石,拥有丰富的副产物,而这些副产物中的相当一部分是制取其他材料的必需品,也是科技推进不可或缺的重要角色.但是,对于大部分副产物来说,石油并非唯一的来源,尤其是如果你已经初涉苯产线或生物质产线,那么可能已经找到了其他来源.对于那些重要副产物,将其自动化是至关重要的,至于自动化的路线则取决于你自己.现在,让我们讲讲从石油中提炼出的四种组分. 目前为止,发电需要用到轻燃油和重燃油,而炼油气是乙烯的优质原料.而等你建造了更多的蒸馏塔以处理裂化流体后,它们都有什么用?以下是一些大致的用途：轻燃油：你会用绝大多数的轻燃油合成柴油.如果还有些富余,中度加氢裂化适合生产丙烯,而轻度加氢裂化则是辛烷的最佳来源.丙烯与辛烷都是重要化工原料,尤其在EV阶段,用于生产环氧树脂或是发电;重燃油：如果只从石油中提炼重燃油,那所得的绝大部分也会被消耗掉用于合成柴油.但是自动化获取更多重燃油十分重要,那是因为从中可以蒸馏出三种重要副产物：甲苯、苯酚和苯.它们都是重要的化工原料.在HV阶段,甲苯尤为重要,你需要消耗大量甲苯才能搓出你的第一枚火箭,才能进入EV阶段;石脑油：你可以在蒸馏塔中蒸馏它,不过要注意此蒸馏配方要求的最大高度,别浪费了出产物.虽然这样需要消耗大量的不锈钢,但这是值得的,等你拥有了这样高度的蒸馏塔后,你就可以自动化获取绝大多数的石油副产物了;炼油气：你可能已经在为了获得乙烯而蒸馏它.你可以使用蒸馏塔和石油裂化装置(参见下一个任务)来获得更高产量和一些有用的副产品。译者注:可以考虑重度氢气裂化以获取大量氦,或是重度蒸汽裂化获取乙烯."
